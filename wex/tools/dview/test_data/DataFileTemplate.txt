The top portion of this txt file is a template for data that is read by wxDView.
Line 1 is a header that ensures we know which lines contain units, title, tStep, etc.
  If the header is missing, we guess that the first line is titles and next is units (unless they are numbers).
Line 2 is the Name of the series, and will be read as it appears.
Line 3 is the time elapsed between Midnight Jan 1 and the first data point, read as a double.
  If the first data point is instantaneous at Midnight, Jan1, set this to 0.0  
  If the first data point is an average over the first hour, set this to 0.5
  If the first data point is at 1AM on Jan1, set this to 1.0
Line 4 is the time step in hours, read as a double.
Line 5 is the data units, read as it appears as a string.
All of the lines after line 4 are data points.  A typical hourly data set for a year would have 8765 lines.

ALL UNITS ARE HOURS.  Decimal hours are accepted.  0.25 is 15 minutes.
Ending with EOF is suggested but not mandatory.
  (Without EOF, trailing returns may be mistakenly read as 0s).
  
***CSV Files***
We also now support CSV files.  CSV files should contain columns of data in the format above, with columns
separated by commas.  Each colum will be loaded into its own channel.
