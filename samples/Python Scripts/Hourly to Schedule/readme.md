# Hourly to Schedule Python Script

This script takes a CSV file with one column of hourly (8760) values and creates three CSV files:

* Hour-by-month periods for weekday schedule

* Hour-by-month periods for weekend schedule

* Table of values by period

It also creates image files of plots for reference.

Use this script when you want to convert time series PPA price multipliers to TOD schedules, or time series retail electricity rates to TOU schedules.
