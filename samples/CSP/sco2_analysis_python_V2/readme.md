# Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO2) Power Cycle Model

This folder contains Python source code and example files for NREL's sCO2 Power Cycle model. The model generates a JSON file with data for SAM's Molten Salt Power Tower User Defined Power Cycle (UDPC) model.

See the [example](/example) folder for documentation and sample scripts.

To use data from this Python model in SAM, run the model, and then in SAM, create or open a Molten Salt Power Tower case and run the sCO2 Cycle Integration macro to import the JSON file created by the model.
