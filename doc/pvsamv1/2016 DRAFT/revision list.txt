=============================

Team Revisions
--------------

- 3D shading calculator chapter including diffuse loss (ARON, STEVE)

- IEC module model (ARON)

- short chapter on battery that refers to battery manual (NICK)

- snow model (SEVERIN)

- linear self shading (JANINE). DONE

Paul Revisions
--------------

Put units in variable tables outside of bold font. DONE

Check that array dc outputs table matches latest version of SAM pv outputs. DONE

Check kW vs W in outputs. DONE

Add Aron (3d shade and iec61853) and Nick (battery) contributions. DONE

Add range (0-90, -180-180, -12-12) to weather data and sun position variable descripton tables for lataitude, longitude, and time zone. DONE

Add range to time zone description (eq. 4.5). DONE

Update irradiance chapter to cover new POA and GHI/DHI inputs and to make it clearer what weather data is reqiured. DONE

Remove references to library editor and clarify how module/inverter and solar resource libraries work in SAM and SSC. DONE

Replace all references to hourly time steps with generic time step for sub-hourly simulations. DONE

Check sunrise and sunset "solar position minute" calculation for new time convention. Explanation is for hourly data and is not clear that "hr" is either beginning of hour or end of hour, so need to update for current implementation. (Section Sunrise and Sunset Hours). DONE

Revise snow coverage as dc loss rather than incident irradiance reduction. DONE

Update shading input SSC variable names (See Table Effective POA irradiance variable definitions). DONE

POA input options. DONE

Irradiance components options. DONE

Curtailment and availability losses. DONE

New DC optimizer loss input. DONE

Correct losses to explain how category losses are applied to total loss. DONE

Revised SAM output variables (no more ac gross/ac net). DONE

Explain in 10.1 DC String Voltage why subarray mismatch is only available for Sandia module model, and find out if it's avalable for IEC61853. DONE

Mismatch model can only be used with a single-diode module model (see PVSAMV1 comment on line 977). DONE

Change units from kWh to kW. DONE

Add units to variable definition tables. DONE

Check inverter input power equation (11.1) and dc power output Pdc, Pdc,net, Pdc,gross to be consistent with SAM outputs. Consider rewriting chapter 10 as 1 DC String Voltage, DC losses, DC power output (remove section on gross DC power). DONE

Backtracking correction? (does not run self-shading model). DONE

Module output voltage and inverter MPPT voltage clipping and subarray mismatch, and how that affects net power output. DONE

Change module output voltage and power variables to Vmp and Pmp as in DC output variables table.

Lifetime simulations and degradation

Check SSC variable names

Check the performance ratio formula now that we've fixed that bug?

Update help references

Check that incident irradiance section describes that beam, diffuse, and global may come from weather file or be calculated depending on input option. DONE

Describe how decomposition model works when POA input is combined with beam shading.

Change "incident" to POA to be consistent with UI.


Wish List
---------

- loss diagram calculations?

Errors
======

p. 10, p.13 time zone and longitude units should be degrees E of 0 instead of degrees W of zero. DONE

p. 14 time of day equation, clarify that time zone range is -12 < tz < 12. DONE

p. 15 sun altitude corrected for refraction Equation 4.19, r for >-0.56 is incorrect.DONE

p. 16 Equation of time Equation for sun altitude angle alpha should be 180/pi, not pi/180. DONE

p. 16 Equations 4.24 and 4.25, sunrise and sunset time equations, for longitude use lambda, which is not defined in the text, instead of lon. DONE

p. 24 Equation 6.11 diffuse components, iso should be cos tilt, not cos AOI. DONE

p. 43 "The cell temperature Tc for the CEC model is calculated using either the NOCT cell temperature model or the heat transfer cell temperature model." That is only true for CEC with database -- for the CEC with user parameters, only the NOCT temp model is available. DONE
