First, I'd like to thank you and congratulate you on putting SAM together. NREL usually delivers high quality software and this is no exception. What I'd like to particularly praise here is that it's very transparent and not a black/grey box as it can sometimes be.

The help files are very detailed, complete and well explained. And the "Send to Excel with equation" function is truly a blessing! I absolutely love it, so useful for understanding how things are calculated. Same goes for the "Financial Model Documentation" spreadsheets.
