Dear Linus,=0A=
=0A=
Attached is a version of the macro that should work for your analysis. To u=
se it, make sure SAM is not running, and save it to the c:/SAM/2017.1.17/ru=
ntime/macros folder. Then start SAM, and you should see the new macro liste=
d with the others.=0A=
=0A=
I made a special modification for you that allows you to include the sell r=
ate that is part of the energy charge table on the Electricity Rates input =
page in the tornado chart. To use it, remove the hourly sell rate from the =
macro inputs, and replace it with the "Energy charge TOU rate matrix" varia=
ble. That variable is a matrix, or two-dimensional array, so is a little co=
mplicated to work with in the macro script. I set it up so that it will wor=
k if you set up the energy rates table on the Electricity Rates input page =
in SAM to have one row for Period 1 Tier 1, as you'll see in the attached .=
sam file, on the "Berlin_Detailed_Main_Case" case.=0A=
=0A=
If you click "View code" on the macro page, you can see the modifications I=
 made: I preceded them with a comment "modification for Linus." If you have=
 some programming or scripting experience, you can make further modificatio=
ns based on mine.=0A=
=0A=
I also fixed a couple of bugs in the script, which are also marked in comme=
nts if you want to see them. They were preventing the macro from working co=
rrectly with inputs that are arrays like the electricity rate escalation ra=
te.=0A=

Dear Linus,=0A=
=0A=
Thank you for sending the files. You helped uncover a bug in the Tornado Ch=
art macro.=0A=
=0A=
The macro does not work properly with input variables that are arrays or ma=
trices instead of single values. In your file, the degradation rate and sel=
l rate inputs are stored in an array and matrix, respectively. Those inputs=
 are causing the errors in the macro.=0A=
=0A=
I will need to make some modifications to the macro so it will work properl=
y with those types of inputs. I will send you an improved version of the ma=
cro when I finish it.=0A=
=0A=
In the meantime, you can either run the macro without those inputs, or run =
the simulations manually to generate ranges of NPV for the different inputs=

Thanks for your really quick response! I am happy to pass along my SAM file=

Please note:=0A=
=0A=
.       The SAM file contains three projects. I am working with the one cal=

=0A=
=0A=
.       I also attached a file with my Tornado chart inputs so you can quic=

=0A=
.       As this is a case for Germany, I manually added hourly electricity =
sell rates. (8760 single values imported from Excel; all values should be 0=
.122 which is equivalent to the current German feed-in tariff)=0A=
=0A=
.       The buy rates are all set to 0.2869, equivalent to the average Germ=
an electricity rate. If I am right, the fact that the rate is named after t=
he Arizona Public Service Co TOU rate shouldn't matter (this was the defaul=
t rate. I disabled TOU modelling and manually added in all buy and sell rat=

Thanks much again for taking the time. I am very grateful for this awesome =

Dear Paul or whom of your colleagues reads this first,=0A=
=0A=
Thanks a lot for your past message. It was very helpful. After your message=
 and attending the last roundtable session I solved most of the inputs prob=
lems and am getting some interesting results for my battery research study.=
 Now I am focusing on sensitivity analysis using the tornado chart macro.=
=0A=
=0A=
I still had some trouble with error messages popping up for certain variabl=
es. Do you have some suggestions here? I assume most errors have the same c=
ause. Output value in all cases is Net Present Value:=0A=
=0A=
1.       Input Value: Module Degradation rate (base value entered into SAM:=
 0.3%)=0A=
=0A=
.       Variation: 33%, alternative: (specified variation of -66%,+66%)=0A=
=0A=
.       Error message: "[132] stack [sp=3D3] error, 4 arguments required."=
=0A=
=0A=
2.       Input Value: Electricity Bill escalation rate (base value entered =
into SAM: 3.5%)=0A=
=0A=
.       Variation: 33%, alternative: (specified variation of -66%,+66%)=0A=
=0A=
.       Error Message: "[132] stack [sp=3D3] error, 4 arguments required"=
=0A=
=0A=
3.       Input: Hourly (subhourly) sell rates ($/kWh) (base value: 0.122, G=
erman feed-in tariff)=0A=
=0A=
.       Variation: 33%=0A=
=0A=
.       Error Message: "[94] runtime exception at line 94: access violation=
: expected numeric, but found array"=0A=
=0A=
Note: I have imported 8760 single values into the hourly data sell rate she=
et under the electricity rates header. Also made sure they are no strings b=
ut all numbers formatting them separately in Excel.=0A=
=0A=
4.       As a counterfactual: When I am working with the inflation rate or =
battery cost per kWh as input, I get great results (basic variation of 33% =
and specified variation for each case both work)=0A=
=0A=
Any ideas what to with these??=0A=

Dear Linus,=0A=
=0A=
Thank you for the message.=0A=
=0A=
1. Energy is lost as it cycles through the battery, so a PV system with a b=
attery will always generate less energy on the whole than a PV system witho=
ut one. The benefit of the battery is that it can store energy from the PV =
array to be used when it is more valuable. With the right kind of electrici=
ty rate structure, the NPV of the PV-battery system will be higher than bat=
tery-only. You can run the "Value of RE System" macro to get a sense of thi=
s: Click the Macros button at the bottom left of the SAM window, and then c=
lick "Value of RE System" in the list of macros.=0A=
=0A=
2. The biggest challenge in modeling systems outside of the U.S. is finding=
 weather data that works with SAM. Aside from that, you have to be careful =
to use consistent currency values throughout your cost and financial assump=
tions. In general, it might be safest to convert costs to dollar values bec=
ause of the large number of default values. Also be careful about the tax a=
nd incentive assumptions: The "Investment Tax Credit" makes some assumption=
s about accelerated depreciation that are based on U.S. tax law. Also, make=
 sure the depreciation assumptions on the Financial Parameters page are app=
ropriate for your analysis. (Depreciation only applies to the Commercial an=
d PPA financial models.)=0A=
=0A=
3. You will have to create your electricity rate structure by hand on the E=
lectricity Rates page. The "modeling a residential PV system in SAM 2016.3.=

Dear SAM support service,=0A=
=0A=
I happily attended Thursday's roundtable session asking some of my question=
s about battery modelling. Thanks again for your great support! Now I have =
the following followups:=0A=
=0A=
1. When I add a battery to my system (PV Watts, residential), the NPV decre=
ases when compared to a solar-only system. This is no surprise, as battery =
economics are complex and depend on a lot of variables. I wonder why the NP=
V even decreases, when I set the battery prize =3D 0, including all other a=
dditional costs that might increase with the installation of a battery (suc=
h as maintenance etc.).=0A=
=0A=
     * Do you know what the potential reasons might be?=0A=
=0A=
2. I am planning to run a case study for a US and a German location.=0A=
=0A=
     * What are potential flaws when applying SAM to other countries?=0A=
=0A=
     * Are the any most commonly made mistakes?=0A=
=0A=
     * Do you possibly have a tutorial explaining what to take into account=
 when applying SAM to other countries?=0A=
=0A=
3. For Germany I am having the trouble that I need to create my own electri=
city rates.=0A=
=0A=
     * Do you have any hints on how to do so?=0A=
=0A=
     * Do you provide a tutorial or summary explaining the rate files used =
by SAM?=0A=
