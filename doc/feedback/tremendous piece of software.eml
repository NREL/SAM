Hello,

Thank you very much for this tremendous piece of software. Although I have =
not modelled anything on yet, as I am still reading and trying to tie down =
all the details, before doing so.

I wish to know if it is possible to actually develop a custom field layout,=
 more specifically, introduce multiple towers on the field. Can that be don=
e with the software or perhaps if you could be so kind to shed some light o=
n how it could be done with the code.

Thank you,
