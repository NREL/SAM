Hello Team,=0A=
=0A=
First and foremost, thank you for creating this very wonderful model. I am=
=0A=
currently focused on studying the financial model behind SAM and utilizing =
it=0A=
for modelling some of our C&I projects in New York state. One of the very=
=0A=
last features that I don't understand is how the model calculates MACRS=0A=
depreciation credits - within the excel file for the model all i see is the=
=0A=
calculation of the 30% ITC credit, and the MACRS credits do not appear.=0A=
=0A=
Is there someone I could have a quick chat with to discuss?=0A=
=0A=
Cheers,=0A=
