Hi Rosemarie,



I'm sorry that I don't know what a reasonable discount rate is in your case=
. As you know, those are very subjective assumptions.



I did find this feasibility study from 2013 that was done for the City of N=
ovato that may be helpful:



http://novato.org/home/showdocument?id=3D17468



I just Googled "PV carport discount rate" to find that -- I don't know anyt=
hing about the quality of that report or the company that prepared it.



Have a great weekend!



Best regards,
Paul.

Thanks, Paul.


I do appreciate your feedback and will incorporate the discount rate and in=
flation. I completely agree with your in regards to this being to simplisti=
c; however, we know that there will be no energy cost savings by installing=
 carports (without any incentives to offset the cost or sized enough to mee=
t the energy demands) so it is expected that there will be no reasonable pa=
yback as the solar PPA cost will be more than the local utility rate. So, t=
he direction was to keep it simple for the bidders and public to utilize an=
d not consider the ROI, but rather an LCOE approach.


Question - in case you know -  what would be a factor (rate) to consider fo=
r loss of opportunity or interest gained on the cash (if it was just sittin=
g in the bank), if it was not utilized for purchasing the solar asset?


Thanks again for your insight and help.  Hopefully, this spreadsheet will b=
e the basis for the financial analyst to build from.  If you have any formu=
las or rates that the LA County should consider from SAM, please direct me.


Sincerely,

Rosemarie

Hi Rosemarie,



I am not in a position to officially evaluate your method, but I can give y=
ou some insight based on my experience with SAM that might help.



The value in Column F of your spreadsheet is not really a levelized cost of=
 energy because it does not involve a discount rate to account for the time=
 value of money, and does not account for inflation. (I assume no debt or t=
axes are involved in this project.). I might call it an estimated project c=
ost. The value in Column H might be the estimated PPA cost.



Do you have a person familiar with county financial practices who might be =
able to give you some insight from the county's perspective? I think these =
estimates are intuitively easy to understand, but someone with some financi=
al experience might find them to be too simplistic.


Best regards,
Paul.

Hi, Paul.



I just spoke to Aron Dobos while you emailed.



As I was going through the excel spreadsheets (below), I realized this is f=
or the owner of the solar.  I was interested in finding out if there was a =
template for LCOE that the County can provide to the bidders, for solar car=
port PPA.  Because I have seen the cost ($/kWh) of solar energy via PPA is =
higher compared to our local utility, it was best to use the LCOE approach,=
 comparing the PPA with cash purchase (which the County does not have the c=
apital to do so).



So, based on your expertise, perhaps you can review the spreadsheet develop=
ed and see if this is simple enough for the bidders and County Board to und=
erstand/utilize, without missing the major elements to consider. Because Ca=
lifornia no longer offers solar incentives, I assume it would only be the I=
TC that would benefit the solar contractor/integrator, aside from profit.  =
Do you think the attached spreadsheet simply depicts the essence of LCOE fo=
r a solar carport installation?



Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!
