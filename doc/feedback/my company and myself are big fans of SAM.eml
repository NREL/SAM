Hello,=0A=
=0A=
First of all I want to say that both my company and myself are big fans of=
=0A=
SAM. We've been using SAM for a couple years now and it has proved invaluab=
le=0A=
in the development stages of our PV projects. Thanks for a great service!=
=0A=
=0A=
Anyways, I am currently working on a small commercial project and have=0A=
received several quotes from solar electricians that differ, to a significa=
nt=0A=
extent, from SAM's projections for installation costs. I think the differen=
ce=0A=
could simply be the labor market where we are working, but I am thinking it=
=0A=
might also be my inputs in SAM. Does SAM allow the user to differentiate=0A=
between a ground mount and roof mounted system? If not, does NREL have=0A=
formulas for correctly estimating different PV system types (ground, roof,=
=0A=
roof + tracking, etc)?=0A=
=0A=
Thanks!=0A=
