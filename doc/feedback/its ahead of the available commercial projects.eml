Subject: [Website Feedback] Battery Model for SODIUM NICKEL TECHNOLOGY=0A=

I'am trying to add a professional battery model to our AI-based PV-concept=
=0A=
optimizer. I did start this development in 2004 after finalizing my R&D=0A=
project on AI-based process simulation, which was financed by the European=
=0A=
Community (2003-2005).=0A=
=0A=
After searching for a long time, I finally found your SAM and I like it a=
=0A=
lot(!). It's ahead of the available commercial products, as far as I can sa=
y=0A=
and workflow is fully compatible to our tool (even better in several=0A=
aspects...). For a project we're working on at the moment, we'd evaluate=0A=
different battery technologies (VRLA, NAS, AQUION, etc.).=0A=
=0A=
My conclusion so far is, that FiAMM's SNT is the solution to choose.=0A=
=0A=
Is it possible to add a battery model tailored to that technology?=0A=
=0A=
Many thanks in advance and=0A=
Best Regards=0A=
