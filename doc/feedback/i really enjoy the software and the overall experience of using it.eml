Dear Paul. Hello.=0A=
=0A=
Thank you for helping me with this issue. Now I understand how SAM deals wi=
th the files, it will make my simulations and my thesis easier to complete.=
 I really enjoy the software and the overall experience of using it. And yo=
ur support and speed in responding to my questions has been optimal.=0A=
=0A=
Have a nice day and keep up the good work!=0A=
Best regards,=0A=
Michael=0A=

Dear Michael,=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Thank you for sending the files.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
The problem is that SAM looks for the measurement height in the file that i=
s selected in the wind resource library list instead of the file shown for =
"Use a wind resource file stored on your computer."=0A=
=0A=
You can just ignore the message: SAM uses the correct file for the simulati=
on. It only uses the wrong file to display that error message on the Wind T=
urbine input page.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
The other option is to put your weather files in the wind resource library =
folder, which, by default in Windows is c:/SAM/2016.3.14/wind_resource. Aft=
er you add your files to that folder, you may need to click the "Refresh Li=
brary" button on the Wind Resource input page to see your files in the list=
. The "Description" field in the library list is whatever is on Line 2 of t=
he .srw file.=0A=
=0A=
We will try to make this work better in the next version of SAM.=0A=

I created a 1kW turbine and added the power curve. My files have only 10m h=
igh data. But when I say that the bug height is 15m it shows the 35m too sh=
ort error. So the only solution would be to have a 45m high turbine and a w=
ind shear coefficient of 0? Or can I use the simulation with confidence eve=
n if the error message appears?=0A=

Thanks in advance for your time with this issue.=0A=
