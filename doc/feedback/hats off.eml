Dear Team,=0A=

I am Shankar and am an associate of PSI Energy, New Delhi, India.=0A=

Hats off to the team for creating such a wonderful platform for evaluating=

clean energy projects, however we have found a small problem.=0A=
=0A=
Since I am from India it would make more sense if Indian product databases=
=0A=
were included, this would also result in the widespread application of=0A=
RETscreen in our country.=0A=
=0A=
We are also in the process of building an Indian database of Renewable Ener=
gy=0A=
Equipment manufacturers along with the technical data required for RETscree=

=0A=
We would like to know how to integrate the same into the software.=0A=
=0A=
We look forward to your invaluable response.=0A=
