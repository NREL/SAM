	<p>Calculation of thermal energy storage (TES) and steam generator system (SGS) piping volumes now more precise.</p>
	<p>Script templates added for implementing new features.</p>
	<p>Runner and header diameter sizing algorithm revamped:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>More robust in border cases.</li>
	 <li>Preferentially selects smaller diameter (cheaper) pipes for out-of-range cases.</li>
	 <li>Diameter limit less restrictive for hot (costlier) than cold header pipes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Calculates (and outputs) HTF properties at design conditions in each pipe section:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Properties include mass flow, velocity, temperature and pressure.</li>
	 <li>Model runs until steady-state is achieved.</li>
	 <li>Occurs before yearly simulation.</li>
	 <li>Default is to perform, but can be skipped.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Added configurable parameters for solar field:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>North/south distance between subfields (northsouth_field_sep)</li>
	 <li>Minimum number of runner expansion loops for each constant diameter segment (Min_rnr_xpans)</li>
	 <li>Frequency of runner expansion loops (L_rnr_per_xpan)</li>

	 <li>Location of the first header expansion loop (offset_xpan_hdr)</li>
	 <li>Number of collector loops per header expansion loop (N_hdr_per_xpan)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Added configurable parameters for thermal energy storage (TES)/power block (PB):</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Bypass valve operation during field recirculation (has_hot_tank_bypass) can bypass just hot tank and feed into cold tank (=true) or bypass both tanks and rest of TES/PB (=false).</li>
	 <li>Minimum HTF temperature that may enter the hot tank (T_tank_hot_inlet_min).</li>

	<p>Custom TES/PB piping pressure drop calculation option based on Darcy-Weisbach and custom minor pressure losses.</p>
	<p>Now reporting TES/PB, runner, header, and loop pipe lengths, diameters, wall thicknesses and number of expansion loops. Minus the number of expansion loops, these output values can be modified and read-in as custom values for subsequent model runs.</p>
	<p>Configurable interconnects have been added that replace hard coded component sizes and associated losses, at the inlet, outlet, crossover, and connections between solar collector assemblies (SCAs). Utilized using the following component and component assembly (interconnect) input files, with example usage in the script templates:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>physical_trough_interconnect_components.csv</li>
	 <li>physical_trough_interconnect_definitions.csv</li>
	</ul>

 <p>Added ability to download different types of files from National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) for SAM's solar models. It is now possible to download individual single-year files, multiple weather files for P50/P90 analysis, and legacy data directly from SAM.</p>
 
			 
<h2>Detailed Photovoltaic Model</h2>


<p>Added weather file checking for for missing temperature or wind speed values.</p>
<p>Updated the Inverter Sizing Information macro to give more information, and renamed it to System Sizing Information.</p>
<p>Fixed kWh/kW metric for subhourly simulations.</p>
<p>Fixed units for GHI data in results.</p>
<p>Fixed problems with PDF report for effective tax rate</p>

<h2>Battery Storage</h2>

<p>Improved battery sizing workflow and interface.</p>
<p>Comprehensive reworking of flow battery inputs and model.</p>
<p>Added a calendar-life model for lithium-ion batteries, and a tabular calendar life degradation input for other chemistries.</p>
<p>Added an iron-flow battery to the list of default types.</p>
<p>Improved battery dispatch control.</p>
<p>Fixed several problems with battery model combined with PPA financial model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acount for grid power purchases to charge battery.</li>
<li>Include battery cost in system installation cost for partnership flip models.</li>
<li>Inconsistencies how SAM reported some time series outputs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process Heat Parabolic Trough</h2>

<p>Added direct thermal energy storage. The default solar multiple has increased from 1 to 2.5 and the default for the new input hours of thermal storage is 6.</p>
<p>Added an input for the wind speed at which the trough is stowed. The default wind stow speed is 25 m/s.</p>

<h2>Process Heat Linear Direct Steam</h2>

<p>Improved numeric convergence in the annual simulation and results in fewer simulation crashes.</p>
<p>Changed controller messages from runtime warnings to notices to minimize information displayed after a simulation. Click the Notices button at the top right of the SAM window to see the messages.</p>

<h2>Molten Salt Power Tower</h2>

<p>Modified the structure by which the tower compute module (cmod_tcsmolten_salt) is called, which affects scripting and API functions. Previously-created LK scripts that are executed using the new SAM release may require modification. The changes occurred in the variable table, in which redundant variables were removed, and the only variable inputs that remain are the minimal set that fully define the system geometry. That is, no calculated parameters are passed as inputs under the new structure. This change simplifies scripting to eliminate the need to provide calculated values as inputs.</p>
<p>Changed some messages from runtime warnings to notices to minimize information displayed after a simulation. Click the Notices button at the top right of the SAM window to see the messages.</p>

<h2>Wind</h2>

<p>Significant changes to the way that SAM corrects power curves for air density. SAM was previously using an older correction method that was appropriate for stall-regulated turbines, but the majority of modern turbines are pitch-regulated. These are better represented by a different correction for air density, which is now implemented. This new method will increase energy production values significantly for turbines at high elevation sites. A description of these two air density calculation methods can be found at <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/38818683/PO310-EWEC2010-Presentation">https://www.scribd.com/document/38818683/PO310-EWEC2010-Presentation</a>.

<p>Added a macro to interpolate solar resource data from hourly to subhourly time resolution.</p>
<p>Improved PV sizing information macro.</p>

<h1>Version 2017.1.17 SSC Version 170, January 2017</h1>

<p>Summary:  This version adds new capabilities to the photovoltaic, battery storage, concentrating solar power, and wind performance models, as well as new models for solar process heat applications.  In addition, major updates to the utility bill calculations allow greater flexiblity for correctly capturing the nuances of complex rate structures.  The scripting features have also been improved, and streamlined use of the SAM Software Development Kit (SDK) is possible using the new SDK code generator.</p>

<h2> Photovoltaics </h2>

<p> Added an inverter model coefficient calculator that directly accepts inverter efficiency test data for inverters not included in the database.  Efficiency data at six different power levels (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 75% and 100%) and three different voltages (Vmin, Vnom, Vmax) is required as input.
</p><p> Added a simple transformer loss model using datasheet no-load loss and full-load loss specifications.
</p><p> Added the ability to automate the 3D shading scene construction and loss calculations using LK scripting.
</p><p> Added a fixed seasonal tilt input option.
</p><p> Fixed several bugs and improved usability of the partial obstruction shading model.
</p><p> Added daily DC and AC lifetime loss inputs.
</p><p> Added DC and AC curtailment input options.
</p><p> Greatly improved simulation speed when using automated battery model dispatch.
</p><p> Improved user interface for self shading inputs.
</p><p> Reorganized PV model hourly outputs to improve clarity.
</p><p> Fixed bug with voltage mismatch calculation when using only one subarray.
</p><p> Fixed bug with degradation calculations when using multiple subarrays.
</p><p> Updated default PV costs for all markets.
</p><p> Updated default DC/AC ratio to 1.2.
</p>

<h2> Battery Storage </h2>

<p> Added option for modeling batteries at the utility scale with manual dispatch.
</p><p> Improved dispatch controller using an iterative algorithm that checks battery constraints at the end of the dispatch, and redispatches until all constraints are met (minimum or maximum state-of-charge, charging from grid when disallowed, exporting PV to grid when can charge battery, etc).
</p><p> Added options to model DC-connected battery system topologies.
</p><p> Added a Vanadium Redox Flow battery voltage model and default parameters.
</p><p> Added a simplified battery model option to PVWatts with automatic peak shaving dispatch.
</p><p> Added AC and DC battery and controller losses to the system loss diagram.
</p>

<h2> PVWatts </h2>

<p> Added a simplified battery model option to PVWatts with automatic peak shaving dispatch.
</p><p> Updated default PV costs for all markets.
</p><p> Updated default DC/AC ratio to 1.2.
</p>

<h2> Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) </h2>

<p> Added new solar process heat models using a trough or steam linear fresnel solar collectors.
</p>

<h2> Molten Salt Power Tower </h2>

<p>Implemented a number of enhancements to the dispatch optimization algorithm, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost penalties for receiver and power cycle startup</li>
        <li>A cost penalty for varying electric power output from one time step to the next</li>
        <li>User-specification of the time-discounting factor that weights production as a function of the time step</li>
        <li>Implementation of a maximum net power output to the grid constraint which limits the net production - including parasitic consumption - to a fixed value, if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Implementation of availablity schedules for solar field production</p>
    <p>Improvement to solar field optimization to allow for explicit consideration of the maximum flux constraint. Using the algorithm 'BOBYQA', the flux is now directly limited via a linearized constraint, rather than included in the optimization objective function via a penalty factor. This improves the reliability of the solar field optimization algorithm. Note that other algorithm options have been removed, along with the flux over-design penalty input.</p>
    <p>Default values for the heliostat field, receiver, and tower have been updated</p>


<h2> Direct Steam Power Tower </h2>

   <p>See "Molten Salt Power Tower" notes regarding solar field optimization.</p>
    <p>Default values for the heliostat field, receiver, and tower have been updated</p>


<h2> Direct Steam Linear Fresnel </h2>

<p>Fixed the Evacuated Receiver field modeling option to use the correct assumptions implied by the "Broken Glass" checkbox. Bug in previous model resulted in simulation of the opposite case.</p>
<p>Fixed the IAM calculation used to model the collector/receiver optical performance. Bug in previous version used the traverse incidence angle in both the Traverse and Longitudinal IAM polynomials.</p>


<h2> CSP generic model</h2>

    <p>Added solar field availability and curtailment losses dialog to allow constant, time-period, and hourly specification</p>
    <p>Updated default values</p>
    <p>The Generic CSP System model was restructured and now uses different regression equations for thermal losses, power block conversion efficiency, and parasitic consumption. This change invalidates previous model configurations and requires revised input values. For more information on generating regression coefficients, view help or visit the SAM website.</p>
    <p>Added DNI adjustment for parasitic loads</p>
    <p>Added exergy correction model for thermal storage charge state</p>

</p><p> Fixed bug to correctly apply availability and curtailment losses when using the Weibull distribution resource model.
</p><p> Added offshore balance of system cost model.
</p><p> Added wind resource data file range checks on data values.
</p>

</p><p> Added state and federal tax yearly tax holidays.
</p>

<h2> LCOE Calculator </h2>

<p> Minor update to the financial input page to improve clarity.
</p><p> Updated all default parameters to be consistent with the NREL Annual Technology Baseline report.
</p>

<h2> Utility Rates </h2>

<p> Improved options for monthly accounting of excess generation.
</p><p> Updated monthly outputs to include year end dollar rollovers.
</p><p> Added additional monthly outputs to balance monthly bill with energy charges and credits.
</p><p> Added ability to handle negative inflation and real discount rates.

</p>

<h2> Scripting </h2>

<p> Fixed a bug in that caused occasional crashes when assigning a value to a variable that was stored on the right hand side as an element in a complex data structure having the same variable name.  e.g. <tt>x = x[1];</tt>
</p><p> Added the SDK Code Generator that will create C/C++, Java, MATLAB, PHP 5/7, VBA, C#, or Python 2/3 template code files for a SAM case.
</p><p> New script-based plotting features for filled or unfilled 2D contour plots, reversed axes, sector plots, color bars, GIF animations, and graphic and textual annotations.
</p><p> Fixed issue with setting working folder when running scripts through the LK debugger.
</p><p> Allow option to break into LK debugger if a script error occurs.
</p><p> Revised curl() function for more control of processing http/https requests.
</p><p> Added JSON read/write functions.
</p><p> Fixed bug in  switch statment <tt>( ? x [ 1, 2, 3 ] )</tt> processing.
</p><p> Allow lazy syntax in table initialization, e.g. <tt> x = { a=1, b='text', c=14.9 };</tt>
</p><p> Updated dview() function syntax to remove scaling factor option and added option to indicate which dataset should be selected in the viewer by default.
</p><p> Added new progressbar() function.
</p><p> Fixed bug in stable_sort() function, and added optional parameter for column sorting.
</p><p> Added macrocall() function to allow calling SAM Macros from within a script.

This version also adds new electricity metering options and other electricity rate improvements to the residential and commercial financial models. It includes a new data browser for tabular results and many enhancements to the LK scripting language.
</p><h2>Photovoltaics</h2>
<ul>
<li> New option to use plane-of-array (POA) irradiance data in the weather file as input, works with data from a pyranometer (broadband) or reference cell
</li><li> New obstruction shading model calculates beam shading factors for a subarray represented in the 3D shading calculator as consisting of up to 8 parallel strings

</li><li> New capability for the module and inverter models with user entered parameters to save and load parameters from a text file
</li><li> Limit albedo values to greater than zero and less than one (non-inclusive). Albedo = 0 and albedo = 1 are invalid (non-physical)
</li><li> Change results variable names for irradiance values to make it clearer which values are from weather file and which values are calculated by transposition model, e.g., change Beam irradiance to Irradiance DNI from weather file 
</li><li> Added warnings to let the user know if SAM calculates a negative irradiance value and sets it to zero
</li><li> Fixed bugs in the Append Snow Data macro

<ul>
<li>Water usage reported for all CSP models
</li><li>New integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) performance model
</li></ul>

</li></ul>
<h2>Parabolic Trough (Empirical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>This release fixes a bug in the implementation of the Cooling Tower Correction defined on the Power Block page. The previous version applied a wet bulb correction when Dry-bulb Basis was selected for the Temp. Correction Mode, and it cancelled the temperature correction when Wet-bulb Basis was selected (i.e. the performance model did not adjust for temperature variation during the annual simulation). This fix did not affect the 6.30.2015 default case, as the Cooling Tower Correction was set to a constant value (i.e. F0 = 1 and the remaining coefficients were zero).

<h2>Molten Salt Power Tower</h2>
<ul>
<li>New dispatch optimization model and plant control algorithm with numerical solver automatically optimizes the dispatch of the thermal energy storage system to maximize plant revenue based on the time-of-use period PPA price multipliers defined on the Time of Delivery Factors page. If dispatch optimization is not selected, the plant control algorithm determines how to operate the power tower system based on the time-of-use periods and Turbine output fraction schedule defined on the new System Control input page.
</li><li>New user-defined power cycle option accepts performance data from an external power cycle model to define the performance characteristics of Rankine or other types of cycles.
</li><li>New Matrix Data results for receiver flux map, solar field optical efficiencies, and heliostat positions
</li><li>Reorganize user inputs: New System Design page has inputs that define the system nameplate capacities and design point parameters, System Control page for the new dispatch optimization inputs and other variables related to the operation of the system, Thermal Storage page now only has inputs to define the capacity of the TES, Parasitics page removed and those inputs moved to input page for relevant component, e.g., power cycle HTF pump power is now on Power Cycle page instead of Parasitics page.
</li><li>Supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle, thermocline storage, and fossil backup are not available in this version of the power tower model because of the new system control and optimization models.
</li></ul>
<h2>Molten Salt Linear Fresnel</h2>
<ul>
<li>New user-defined power cycle option accepts performance data from an external power cycle model to define the performance characteristics of Rankine or other types of cycles.
</li></ul>
<h2>Direct Steam Power Tower</h2>
<ul>
<li>This release correctly calculates heliostat tracking parasitics. The old version was underreporting this value. This fix reduces the annual energy output by about 0.5% in the default case.
</li></ul>
<h2>Wind</h2>
<ul>
<li> Added step-by-step wizard to help introduce new users to the wind model

<h1>Version 2015.6.30 SSC Version 45, June 2015</h1>
<p> This is a major release that introduces several new models:</p>
<ul>
<li> PV with battery energy storage, including simulation of the whole system lifetime.
</li><li> Third party lease or PPA financing for distributed systems.
</li><li> Simple LCOE calculator based on a fixed charge rate.
</li></ul>
<h2>Photovoltaics</h2>
<ul>
<li> A new battery model for lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries in grid-connected photovoltaic systems with storage. The model accounts for storage capacity, terminal voltage, temperature, and capacity fade.</li>
<li> A detailed manual dispatch controller allows custom tailoring of how battery energy is discharged to meet a building or facility's electric load. We hope to add automated and optimized dispatch controller strategies in future versions of the model.</li>
<li> A new lifetime analysis mode makes it possible to run year-by-year simulations over the analysis period at hourly or sub-hourly (down to one minute) time-steps. This mode is particularly important when analyzing battery systems to properly account for the effect of cycling on battery life and battery replacement costs.</li>
<li> A battery macro which allows quick financial comparison of lifetime costs between a PV system with batteries, a PV system without batteries, and no PV system.</li>
<li> New options to apply degradation to the array's DC output and run simulation over the entire analysis period.</li>
<li>New input for DC power optimizer loss, associated new buttons to overwrite defaults with appropriate losses for central inverters, dc optimizers, and microinverters.</li>
<li>Performance ratio bug fix- performance ratio was being incorrectly calculated using post-shading and post-soiling irradiance. Updated to use pre-shading and pre-soiling irradiance. This will decrease performance ratios slightly in cases where shading or soiling are present.</li>
<li>Added model for predicting energy lost due to snow fall on a PV system. Requires snow depth data in the weather file.</li>
<li>Bug fixes with SunEye and Solar Pathfinder file imports.</li>
<li>Bug fixes in inverter sizing macro.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Power Tower (Molten Salt)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Under some conditions, the model was not tracking tower/receiver startup parasitics. We have fixed this in the current release. The changes result in less than 1% decrease in annual energy production for the default case. The changes may be slightly more significant for less sunny locations.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Wind </h2>
<ul>
<li> Bug fix in cost and scaling model for the power curve of user defined turbines. Will change the answers for user-defined turbines.</li>
<li> Bug fix- was skipping negative x values for wind turbine layout import button.</li>
</ul>
<h2> PPA Financial Models </h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved metrics describing project term debt to make clear the relationship between size of debt and net capital cost.</li>
<li>Enabled single owner cash flow send-to-Excel with equations for debt percentage debt sizing option.</li>
<li>Improved cash flow to show net capital cost calculation.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Residential and Commercial Financial Models </h2>
<ul>
<li> Revised net metering calculations: One bi-directional meter where
sell rates are equal to buy rates except for monthly energy rollover
with year end sell rate. One can expect the renewable system to offset
peak demand and energy charges.
</li><li> Revised non-net metering (gross feed in tariff) calculations:
Two uni-directional meters: a) system to grid where utility buys
renewable system energy at specified sell rate, b) grid to load where
property owner buys electricity at the specified buy rate. One can
expect system specified outputs to be the sum of the two meters and that
 the renewable system will not offset peak demand or energy charges but
will be compensated at the corresponding sell rate.
</li></ul>
<h2> New Financial Models </h2>
<ul>
<li> Third Party Ownership model for a photovoltaic system installed on
residential and commercial property with a third party that owns the
system and sells power to the residential or commercial customer under a
 lease or power purchase agreement.
</li><li> LCOE Calculator uses a simple fixed charge rate method to
calculate the levelized cost of energy for market-level or very
preliminary project analysis.
</li></ul>
<h2> Miscellaneous </h2>
<ul>
<li> Improved rendering speed of time series data viewer for high temporal resolution simulation results.
</li><li> Added searchable script library function help system.
</li><li> Improved syntax error reporting in script editor.
</li><li> Updated scripting language reference manual.
</li><li> Improved search and filter for graph editing and data tables in the results viewer.
</li><li> Bug fixes in several built-in script library functions.
</li><li> If a leap day is included in the weather file, it will be
automatically skipped for purposes of annual simulation assuming 8760
hours in a year.
</li><li> SAM can now read TYA weather files (TMY3 update).
</li><li> Fixed typo in name of Santa Fe weather file.
</li><li> Updated PPA price defaults for all technologies.
</li><li> Renamed adjust.factor to adjust.constant to make it consistent with stored values
</li></ul>

 <h2>Photovoltaic (detailed)</h2>
 <p>New 3D shading calculator will estimate linear beam shading factors based on a 3D scene entered by the user.</p>
 <p>Added support for subhourly simulations (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minute, and 1 hour)</p>
 <p>Added an inverter sizing macro to give additional information about system sizing by analyzing simulation results.</p>
 <p>Self-shading calculator for large arrays is now enabled for all four PV sub-arrays, and inputs are simplified for easier
 use.</p>
 <p>Reorganized input pages for easier use by separating Array and PV Subarrays pages into System Design, Shading, and Losses
 pages</p>
 <p>Transitioned from derates to losses to be more intuitive and consistent with industry practice</p>
 <p>Self-shading for one-axis tracking systems now uses the same algorithm as self-shading for fixed tilt systems for
 consistency and more accurate self-shading calculation including estimated nonlinear losses</p>
 <p>Changed the calculation method for auto-sized systems to get closer to the desired DC-AC ratio.</p>
 <p>Clipping losses, nighttime tare losses, and inverter power consumption losses now reported correctly. Previous versions
 reported losses for one inverter, not the total number of inverters in the system.</p>
 <p>Added a $/Wdc option for inverter pricing and changed to this unit by default.</p>
 <p>Cost assumptions have been updated to match the latest PV cost data.</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic (PVWatts)</h2>
 <p>Revised algorithms according to the PVWatts version 5 update, including an updated inverter performance model, self-shading
 or backtracking for 1 axis trackers, module models for standard/premium/thin-film types, updated system loss assumptions.</p>
 <p>Added support for subhourly simulations (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minute, and 1 hour)</p>
 <p>Cost assumptions have been updated to match the latest PV cost data.</p>
 <h2>High Concentration PV</h2>
 <p>The cell efficiency table is now interpolated based on incident DNI, rather than cell POA.</p>
 <p>Updated the thermal model to use incident DNI rather than cell POA now consistent with the Sandia model.</p>
 <h2>Wind</h2>
 <p>Access to NREL's new WIND Toolkit data through the SAM user interface</p>
 <p>Auto-layout capability for farms by entering a desired farm size</p>
 <p>Turbine spacing in a farm is now entered in units of rotor diameters instead of meters.</p>
 <p>Hub height was not previously accounted for in the air density calculations to compute the power curve when inputting
 turbine parameters and using a Weibull resource distribution</p>
 <p>The air density equation used to compute the power curve when inputting turbine parameters has been updated with more
 accurate constants:</p>
 <p>Siting considerations page has now become a macro</p>
 <p>NREL's new Land-Based Balance of System cost model has been integrated into the user interface</p>
 <p>Default turbine spacing assumptions have changed.</p>
 <p>Cost assumptions have been updated to match the latest wind cost data.</p>
 <h2>Parabolic Trough (Physical)</h2>
 <p>Fixed bracket heat loss calculations to match empirical correlations in the Physical Trough Manual. The result is slightly
 reduced bracket losses.</p>
 <p>Improved the convergence of the first-principles heat loss model.</p>
 <h2>Parabolic Trough (Empirical)</h2>
 <p>Fixed a problem with calculation of the time zone</p>
 <p>Updated user interface with simplified selection of components from the libraries</p>
 <h2>Power Tower Technologies (Molten Salt, Direct Steam)</h2>
 <p>Replaced heliostat field simulation model to better support data formats provided by SolarPILOT and to automate field
 geometry characterization. The new model incorporates layout, flux, and efficiency characterization simulations directly. In
 the previous model, heliostat field optical efficiency was evaluated on a regularly spaced azimuthal/elevation sun position
 grid, and values were interpolated with a simple bilinear algorithm. The new model evaluates efficiency at the same sun
 positions as the flux maps, and efficiency is evaluated using Gauss-Markov estimation, which amounts to linear interpolation
 among irregularly spaced data points.</p>
 <p>Added the ability to specify the number of flux maps used in field characterization. These settings are available on the
 Tower and Receiver technology pages. The user may also specify the resolution of the flux map.</p>
 <p>Previously, the receiver flux distribution was determined during
simulation by choosing the pre-generated flux map closest
 in sun position to the current point. This was updated to allow
interpolation among several nearby flux maps with a weighting
 approach.</p>
 <p>The previous DELSOL3-based field layout and characterization algorithm is replaced with NREL's SolarPILOT software. The new
 approach emphasizes full layout and position-based simulation rather than DELSOL's zonal approach.</p>
 <p>Improved accuracy of heliostat field characterization given x-y position layout. This was poorly supported under DELSOL3,
 but is a point of emphasis with the new SolarPILOT algorithms.</p>
 <p>Added support for heliostat optical parameters, including heliostat canting (individual mirror facets) in the horizontal and
 vertical direction, ideal vs. flat (no) focusing, and options for specifying facet aiming (canting).</p>
 <p>Updated heliostat field optimization algorithms. Please note that documentation is still under development for these
 algorithms. The user may refer to
 <a href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Algorithms">http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Algorithms</a>
 for an overview of the methods.</p>
 <h2>Power Tower (Molten Salt)</h2>
 <p>Support for automatic re-layout of the heliostat field in parametric or stochastic simulations</p>
 <p>Removed cavity receiver option until model can be integrated with new system level model</p>
 <p>Fixed an error that occurred when the number of receiver panels was less than the number of flux points.</p>
 <p>Updated the user interface to simplify inputs.</p>
 <h2>Power Tower (Direct Steam)</h2>
 <p>Replaced estimated receiver thermal efficiencies in UI with estimated receiver heat loss. The heat loss is typically
 less dependent on flux, so specifying this value allows the thermal efficiency to automatically vary with flux.</p>
 <p>Solar field modeling changes detailed for the Molten Salt Power Tower.</p>
 <p>Automatic optimization of the receiver during simulation runs is still under development and is not yet available. However,
 optimization within the interface on the Solar Field page is available.</p>
 <h2>Molten Salt Technologies (Physical Trough, Power Tower, Linear Fresnel)</h2>
 <p>The field-to-storage HX sizing for the controller previously
specified that the HX duty should be (solar multiple = 1 ) *
 (power block design thermal power). This makes the size adequate if
the field always deploys to the power block first, then
 only balance is sent to storage. This is not desired behavior,
especially for peaker type plants. The HX sizing is now simply
 the solar field design power (solar multiple) * (power block design
thermal power). Additionally, the off-design heat exchanger
 model has been updated to maintain physical performance when the
load is near the design load.</p>
 <h2>Geothermal</h2>
 <p>Removed resource temperature and depth lookup via NREL web service in accordance with a recommendation from NREL geothermal
 technology experts.</p>
 <h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>
 <p>Updated algorithm to use a triple-mode solar water tank model that more accurately models actual system behavior.</p>
 <p>Added support for subhourly simulations (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minute, and 1 hour)</p>
 <p>Added electric load input option for economic analysis.</p>
 <h2>Residential and Commercial Financial Models</h2>
 <p>Added a new building load estimator for the residential and
commercial financial models that generates an hourly electric
 load profile based on information you provide about the building
size and electric appliances. Requires monthly electric load
 data to scale normalized profile to actual energy usage.</p>
 <p>Removed the Commercial PPA and Independent Power Producer financial models because they were redundant with each other, and
 with the more representative Single Owner model, which is now the only option for modeling PPA projects with a single
 owner.</p>
 <p>Improvements to the utility rate database (URDB) inputs for the residential and commercial financial models and calculations
 to work with Version 3 of the OpenEI database.</p>
 <h2>Utility-scale Models</h2>
 <p>New financial metrics for the Power Purchase Agreement financial models: SAM now reports both the levelized cost of energy
 metric based only on project costs after taxes and incentives but without the developer's return on investment, and the
 levelized PPA price, which accounts for both costs and the developer's return</p>
 <p>Major update to the Send to Excel with Equations feature.</p>
 <h2>Scripting</h2>
 <p>Scripts are no longer embedded in project files.</p>
 <p>Scripting language is the new LK language which is much faster and more powerful.</p>
 <p>New functions in standard library to create and export plots of data, reading/writing CSV files, HTML dialogs, web access
 and geocoding, new graphical user interface commands, Excel automation (Windows only), and direct access to the underlying
 simulation engine (SSC).</p>
 <p>Added a script-based Macro system to support integrated extensions to SAM.</p>
 <h1>Version 2014.1.14 January 2014 (Update)</h1>
 <p>This is a maintenance update to SAM 2013.9.20 that addresses several bugs and other issues It does not add any new
 features.</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic</h2>
 <p>Fixed a bug for the photovoltaic models with southern hemisphere weather files with the Tilt=Latitude option
 enabled that caused SAM to generate a simulation error message.</p>
 <p>Fixed a bug for the PVWatts system model with 1-axis tracking. The bug caused the model to enable backtracking with a GCR of
 -1. This caused unrealistic results for a few hours of the year, but did not noticeably affect the system's total annual
 output.</p>
 <p>Corrected the Flat Plate PV model's inverter library entry for the Toshiba (TMEIC) 500U. The correct values for the
 voltage and current ratings are: Vdcmax = 600 V, Idcmax = 1600 A, MPPT low = 320 V, and MPPT high = 550 V.</p>
 <p>Updated the CEC inverter library to the January 2014 version.</p>
 <p>Fixed a mistake in the PDF report for photovoltaic models with Commercial PPA, Utility IPP, or Single Owner financing in
 Specify PPA Price mode to show meaningless symbols for the PPA price value. This issue does not affect values that
 appear in the SAM user interface -- it only affects the PDF report.</p>
 <p>Changed the Flat Plate PV default assumption on the Array page
for ground reflectance to not use the albedo value from the
 weather file by default because the albedo values in the standard
weather files tend to be unreliable. By default, SAM uses the
 0.2 value specified in the monthly albedo input table instead of
reading hourly values from the weather file.</p>
 <h2>Concentrating Solar Power</h2>
 <p>Fixed a bug in the energy loss diagram for concentrating solar
power models (CSP) with a large portion of the thermal energy
 to the power block supplied by the fossil backup system that caused
the energy loss diagram to display an incorrect value for
 the System Output to Grid quantity.</p>
 <p>For the linear Fresnel model, fixed an issue with the the collector azimuth angle variable on the Solar Field page being
 disabled with the collector incidence angle table option on the Collector and Receiver page.</p>
 <p>Fixed an issue that caused the power tower model with thermocline storage to report an incorrect warning about the storage
 fluid temperature being outside of its operating range.</p>
 <p>For the physical trough model, fixed some problems that caused simulations to fail for low temperature applications. The
 evacuated tube convergence algorithm could fail to converge when the DNI is zero and the HTF is losing energy to its
 surroundings, and some of the property lookup routines failed when field temperatures fell below zero degrees Celsius.</p>
 <p>For the physical trough and generic solar system concentrating
solar power models Thermal Storage page, fixed the units in
 the thermal storage capacity label. The correct units are MWht, not
MWt. This is a mistake in the user interface label and does
 not affect simulations.</p>
 <p>Fixed a mistake in the Linear Fresnel PDF report that showed aperture area of a single collector instead of the total
 aperture area.</p>
 <p>Updated the TRNSYS source code files.</p>
 <h2>Residential and Commercial Financial Models</h2>
 <p>Fixed a bug for the residential and commercial financial models, that caused SAM to apply the percent of annual
 output factor from the Performance Adjustment page twice.</p>
 <p>For the residential and commercial financial models with net metering, corrected the Sales/Purchases without System value
 for January. (The values for February through December were correct.) This caused the Net Savings with System value in the
 Metrics table to be incorrect.</p>
 <p>For the residential and commercial financial model results, corrected the monthly Energy Rate Charge in [mmm]
 ($) label, and added the missing Year 1 monthly sales/purchases without system ($) variable is missing. The
 label should be Energy Charge in [mmm] ($). </p>
 <p>For the residential and commercial financial models with the
 Normalize supplied load profile to monthly utility bill
 data option on the Electric Load page enabled, SAM used the
original, non-normalized peak load to calculate monthly
 demand charges. With this update, SAM uses the normalized peak load
values to calculate the demand charges. Although the old
 behavior is appropriate with 10- or 15-minute load data when the
magnitude of the normalized data is similar to the original
 data and you want to preserve the original peak values, we decided
to change it because it may be unexpected behavior, and is
 not appropriate when you normalize the load to much higher or lower
magnitudes than the original data.</p>
 <p>Fixed the formula in the cash flow spreadsheets with equations for residential and commercial financial models to correctly
 calculate state ITC amount. The formula in Cell B51 was incorrect.</p>
 <h1>Version 2013.9.20 September 2013</h1>
 <p>This version includes several improvements to photovoltaic
modeling, utility rate and net metering calculations, bug fixes
 to concentrating solar power models, a revised and much faster solar
 water heating model, new wake modeling for wind farms, and
 updated default input values. In addition, this version comes with
several new sample files to demonstrate various SAM
 features, including how to calculate net metering impacts with
different utility rates and electric loads.</p>
 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Fixed an issue on OS X systems when editing the library and weather file search path.</p>
 <h2>Residential and Commercial Financial Models</h2>
 <p>Updated utility rate inputs to be compatible with Version 2 of the OpenEI Utility Rate Database. For each utility in the
 database, SAM groups rate structures by category to make it easier to find a specific structure.</p>
 <p>Net metering algorithm now carries over monthly credits and applies an optional year end sell rate. (Older versions of SAM
 assumed used hourly accounting for net metering.)</p>
 <p>Renamed hourly and monthly results variables, and removed duplicate and confusing variables.</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic</h2>
 <p>Added two options to model inverters not in the Sandia inverter database: The datasheet option allows you to
 enter parameters from a manufacturer datasheet. The part load curve option allows you to enter part-load efficiency
 curve that is linearly interpolated across the range of operation.</p>
 <p>For self-shading shading of 1-axis trackers, a new ground coverage ratio input replaces the row width and spacing inputs to
 avoid being able to model systems with inconsistent array layout inputs.</p>
 <p>Added estimation of output reduction due to self-shading of 1 axis trackers using an approximation that calculates geometric
 beam irradiance shading fraction from the GCR and assumes a long row. The diffuse sky and reflected irradiance is also
 reduced based on the view factor reduction to adjacent rows. Note: does not currently model nonlinear impact of electrical
 mismatch losses</p>
 <p>Added additional detail in energy loss diagram to better characterize the source of each loss: irradiance reductions due to
 shading, inverter operation and clipping, and others.</p>
 <p>Improved labeling of results variables.</p>
 <p>Bug fix to backtracking algorithm: The rotation angle limit is now applied correctly for backtracked systems.</p>
 <p>Bug fix in fixed tilt system self-shading code: The diffuse irradiance view factor reduction calculations were modified
 slightly to more accurately characterize the light blocking on the array.</p>
 <p>Added an option in PVWatts to change the mounting configuration of the PV array. The selection of an open rack or
 roof-standoff mounting system adjusts the installed nominal operating cell temperature (INOCT) of the modules in the
 system.</p>
 <h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>
 <p>Replaced the solar water heating performance model with a faster model.</p>
 <h2>Concentrating Solar Power</h2>
 <p>Physical trough, power tower, direct steam tower and linear
Fresnel: Fixed an error in the powerblock startup calculations.
 This is not a problem for simulations where the startup time is less
than the simulation timestep, so the default cases
 (direct steam power tower and linear Fresnel) that use this model
are not affected. Models where the startup time is greater
 than the simulation time may have been underpredicting the required
startup energy.</p>
 <p>Physical trough, power tower, direct steam tower and linear
Fresnel: Corrected an error in the hybrid cooling model that
 decreases annual results using hybrid cooling model between by as
much as 0.5% for the Molten Salt Tower and 1.75% for the
 Physical Trough model. These are worst case differences at small wet
 cooling fractions. Larger wet cooling fractions result in
 smaller differences.</p>
 <p>Dish Stirling: Fixed a significant bug that underestimated
shading losses in the default dish Stirling model. The annual
 energy in the default case decreases by 6.5%. As the spacing between
 modules increases, the difference between the old and new
 codes decreases and eventually disappears.</p>
 <p>Empirical trough and the generic solar system model: the turbine startup energy calculation was not properly deducting
 energy for systems without thermal energy storage and with a large turbine thermal startup requirement. For these cases, the
 error in annual output could be greater than 12% (output went up after the fix), depending on the power block startup energy
 requirement. The impact for the default values in both the GSS and Empirical trough was minimal.</p>
 <p>Generic solar model: the optical efficiency table is accompanied
by a checkbox indicating whether the table should be
 interpolated or should simply return the nearest value. The checkbox
 values were backwards i.e. checking interpolate 
 actually caused the model to return the nearest value, and vice
versa. This bug would be most significant in cases with
 significant optical efficiency variation over small changes in the
angular inputs, or in tables with a small number of values
 that differ substantially from each other. For the default case,
change in annual output was less than 1%.</p>
 <p>The powerblock model for the physical trough and molten salt
power tower models was not correctly accounting for powerblock
 startup times greater than 1 hour (note the default is 0.5). The fix
 will cause annual energy output to decrease for these
 cases. For example, in the molten salt power tower, using the
defaults and changing the powerblock startup time to 1.5 hours
 decreases the annual energy by about 4%. This bug will also affect
custom simulations using timesteps less than the powerblock
 startup time.</p>
 <p>Improved TRNSYS convergence of molten salt power tower during periods when the solar field is off but storage and the
 powerblock are still operating. The default case shows around a 0.2% increase in annual energy, and an elimination of TRNSYS
 convergence errors reported in the log file.</p>
 <p>Improved startup and pumping power calculations in direct steam power tower. Default case annual energy increases around
 0.8%.</p>
 <p>Fixed bug in air cooling model that caused fan parasitics to switch to 0 in some cases where it was operating. The fixed
 version reduces the default power tower models annual energy output around 1%.</p>
 <h2>Wind</h2>
 <p>Created the ability to import a user defined turbine layout for a wind farm.</p>
 <p>Added the ability to model wind wake effects using the Eddy-Viscosity model.</p>
 <p>Added the ability to model wind wake effects using the Park model.</p>
 <p>Worked with Mistaya Inc to develop the capability for Windographer software to export data in SAM's .srw wind resource file
 format.</p>
 <p>Increased the maximum number of turbines that can be analyzed in a wind farm from 250 to 300.</p>
 <p>Added a capability to display information about siting considerations for a particular location. SAM communicates with the
 NREL Wind Prospector online tool to obtain the information.</p>
 <h2>Geothermal</h2>
 <p>Fixed a bug where certain calculation were not updated during parametric runs.</p>
 <p>Fixed a bug that caused SAM to calculate the temperature drop for an EGS resource incorrectly.</p>
 <h1>Version 2013.1.15 January 2013 (Update)</h1>
 <p>SAM 2013.1.15 is a maintenance update that addresses a few issues with the previous version. For a full description of new
 features in this version, see the SAM 2012.11.30 description below.</p>
 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Fixed an issue that caused SAM to stop responding when viewing SRW wind data files with invalid format.</p>
 <p>Updated Performance Adjustment variable group names so they appear correctly in lists of variables (parametrics, etc.).</p>
 <p>Resized boxes on input pages to fit notes in orange font.</p>
 <p>Fixed an issue with the advanced utility IPP financial models that prevented the model from converging when the LCOE was
 very small.</p>
 <p>Fixed an issue with the cash flow Send to Excel feature that that caused percentages to be incorrectly displayed in Excel,
 and caused inaccurate escalation rate calculations.</p>
 <p>Disable Excel Exchange by default.</p>
 <p>Fixed a problem with TOU adjustment rates issues with net metering and load.</p>
 <p>Made the utility rate database window resizable and added scrollbars to make it easier to see long names and
 descriptions.</p>
 <p>Fixed a problem with cash flow graphs in reports for the advanced utility IPP financial models that caused multiple bars to
 appear on the graph.</p>
 <p>Fixed a problem with the weather data reader so that it correctly exports data headings.</p>
 <p>Fixed a problem with the Save with Hourly Options result that prevented SAM for saving data with unusual numbers of values
 (e.g., 200 values for statistical simulation).</p>
 <p>SAM now prompts you for a folder to save reports, and uses the .zsam file location by default instead of automatically
 saving it in the user folder without any feedback.</p>
 <h2>SamUL</h2>
 <p>PtOptimize() script function returns true/false depending on whether solar field optimization was successful.</p>
 <p>Added PtGetOutput() script function to return all messages from running PTGen via PtOptimize()</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic</h2>
 <p>Flat plate PV did not read shading inputs for Subarray 1.</p>
 <p>Flat plate PV azimuth angle value did not import correctly from files saved with older.</p>
 <p>Updated report templates for PV systems to correct formatting and logic issues.</p>
 <p>Flat plate model now correctly imports azimuth angle value from files saved with SAM 2011.12.2.</p>
 <p>Fixed HCPV system costs page icon in navigation menu.</p>
 <p>Fixed tab order on photovoltaic input pages.</p>
 <p>Removed parentheses in photovoltaic model results labels so they appear correctly in the time series data viewer.</p>
 <h2>Concentrating Solar Power</h2>
 <p>Update TRNSYS source code files for all CSP models</p>
 <p>Fixed a problem with the empirical trough model when the solar field stow angle was 180 degrees.</p>
 <p>Fixed bug that results in Empirical trough model annual output error of 4%.</p>
 <p>Improved input variable labels on Solar Field page for exact area and actual aperture. </p>
 <p>Fixed issue with empirical trough model solar field initial temperature. This had a very small impact on the system's
 total annual output.</p>
 <h2>Wind</h2>
 <p>Fixed a problem for the wind cost model that caused values to be zero.</p>
 <p>Corrected the wind PTC default value.</p>
 <p>Added a limitation of 300 turbines to the total number of turbines in a system with an error message when more turbines are
 entered into the farm layout.</p>
 <h2>Geothermal</h2>
 <p>Fixed a problem with energy values shown in the Geothermal report.</p>
 <h2>Biopower</h2>
 <p>Fixed a problem with the energy loss diagram that caused labels to overlap.</p>
 <h1>Version 2012.11.30 November 2012</h1>
 <p>This version includes several improvements to the existing
performance models and enhancements to the user interface. The
 new solar wizard makes it easier to get started using SAM to model
solar projects. This version also includes a new energy loss
 diagram, new report templates, and an option to export cash flow
data to Excel with formulas.</p>
 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Automatically download tax credit and incentive data for United States locations from the online Database of State
 Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE).</p>
 <p>SAM Solar Wizard steps you through the minimum number of inputs to set up a basic analysis for a photovoltaic (PVWatts),
 parabolic trough (Empirical Trough), or solar water heating system.</p>
 <p>Loss diagrams for all performance models except wind and geothermal show where energy losses occur in the system.</p>
 <p>Export cash flow tables to Excel with formulas for the residential, commercial, commercial PPA, and utility IPP financial
 models.</p>
 <p>Expanded list of retail electricity rate structures available for download from the NREL OpenEI utility rate database.</p>
 <p>Improved Performance Adjustment page (replaces Annual Performance page) to model curtailment, degradation, availability, and
 other operating losses with new hour-by-month factors.</p>
 <p>New report templates.</p>
 <p>Reorganize navigation menu and input page to make input variables easier to find.</p>
 <p>Remove graph sliders and optimization analysis options because the Parametric Analysis option is a better and more
 transparent way to show variation of results over a range of inputs.</p>
 <p>Change the default value of some input variables to better match current market conditions, including changing the default
 analysis period from 30 years to 25 years.</p>
 <h2>PVWatts System Model</h2>
 <p>Bug fix: When Force tilt=latitude is enabled, surface tilt is now calculated as the absolute value of the location
 latitude to ensure that for locations in the southern hemisphere, the tilt value is positive. (SAM requires all array tilt
 values to be positive.)</p>
 <p>Bug fix: PVWatts will generates an error message if it reaches an invalid data line in the weather file. Previously, PVWatts
 may have continued through the file using unpredictable values as input.</p>
 <h2>Flat Plate PV Component Models</h2>
 <p>Enhancement: SAM has been upgraded to allow specifying up to four subarrays with different orientation, shading, and soiling
 inputs. The subarrays are assumed to have the same number of modules per string, and are wired in parallel connected to the
 single inverter.</p>
 <p>Enhancement: Relative air mass is reported as an hourly output.</p>
 <p>Enhancement: System performance ratio (factor) is calculated in a consistent manner between flat plat and CPV systems. See
 documentation for more details. The calculation method does not change the results.</p>
 <p>Enhancement: DC and AC derate factors are specified as fractions, not percentages. This makes the derate convention
 consistent with PVWatts. SAM automatically updates values in files created with older versions with percentage values.</p>
 <p>Bug fix: The single point efficiency (SPE) inverter occasionally produced nameplate power with zero incident irradiance. An
 example is shown in the plot below, for a 4 kW SPE inverter.</p>
 <p>In the default residential PV system with a 4 kW SPE inverter, this fix reduces the annual AC kWh by approximately 1.8
 %.</p>
 <p>Bug fix: The Sandia PV module model did not correctly use the
database-specified temperature coefficients. The temperature
 coefficients used were A = -3.56, B=-0.075, dT=3 when the Use
database values option was selected in the user interface. For
 the default utility scale system in SAM, the fix increases the
annual output using the default Sandia module by approximately
 0.3 %.</p>
 <p>Bug fix: The Sandia PV module model now reports the module temperature as the ambient temperature under zero irradiance
 conditions. The previous version of SAM reported 0 deg C under some zero irradiance conditions. This does not change the
 results.</p>
 <p>Bug fix: Night-time inverter parasitic power is now correctly deducted from the total energy. This reduces SAM's annual AC
 power production by approximately 0.03 %, using the utility scale default system as a reference.</p>
 <p>Updated module and inverter databases.</p>
 <h2>High-X Concentrating PV System Model</h2>
 <p>Revision: Tracker power is now specified as a fraction of nameplate capacity. As a result, tracker parasitic power by
 default scales with system size. Project files from old versions of SAM are upgraded accordingly.</p>
 <p>Updated inverter database.</p>
 <h2>Concentrating Solar Power Models (CSP)</h2>
 <p>Updated HTF fluid library.</p>
 <p>Bug fix: The molten salt power tower now allows the user to locate a heliostat on the x axis.</p>
 <p>The runner and header heat loss calculations in the physical trough model were modified. The reported losses should
 approximately double for the default case. The net electric energy output will decrease around .1 - .2% for most cases. For
 systems with a larger number of field subsections, the effect will be slightly more significant.</p>
 <p>Therminol 66 and 59 are now available as heat transfer fluids for the trough models. Rough guidelines for temperature
 limits of all HTFs are provided in the user interface.</p>
 <p>The absolute pipe roughness in the external molten salt and direct steam tower models was changed from 1.5E-5 to 4.5E-5 m.
 This change results in a high pumping parasitic, but in regards to net energy is largely offset by an increased thermal
 efficiency caused by improved convective heat transfer coefficients.</p>
 <p>The flux map DELSOL returns for the external molten salt and direct steam receiver now reports normalized values that
 indicate for each node 1-12 the fraction of the total power incident on the receiver that is absorbed. This revised metric
 corrects for a mismatch between the DELSOL reported field efficiency and the efficiency that can be calculated from the flux
 map output.</p>
 <h2>Wind</h2>
 <p>A new Turbine input page with an option to either choose a turbine power curve from a library of commercially available
 turbines, or to specify a turbine's performance characteristics (coefficient of power, tip-speed ratio, etc.)</p>
 <p>Location Lookup now accesses the NREL Eastern Wind Integration Dataset in addition to the Western dataset.</p>
 <p>Added a set of representative wind data files for typical resource and terrain types in the United States.</p>
 <p>Improved the wind data file format to make it easier to edit with spreadsheet software and changed the wind data file
 extension from .swrf to .srw.</p>
 <p>The Wind System Costs page has a new option to estimate costs for onshore and offshore wind projects using the NREL Capital
 Cost model.</p>
 <p>New hour-by-month performance adjustment inputs to facilitate modeling operating losses due to curtailment and maintenance
 downtime.</p>
 <h2>Biopower</h2>
 <p>The Feedstock page now provides access to the U.S. Billion Ton Update study for dedicated energy crops in addition to the
 agricultural residue database.</p>
 <p>A new life-cycle emissions model estimates greenhouse gas emissions of biomass collection, transport, pre-processing,
 combustion, and CO2 re-uptake.</p>
 <h2>Geothermal Power</h2>
 <p>Added the ability to estimate plant costs for binary geothermal units.</p>
 <h1>Version 2012.5.11 May 2012</h1>
 <p>For SAM 2012.5.11, we added one new performance model, made
several improvements to algorithms to decrease simulation run
 times, and made the usual bug fixes, usability improvements, and
documentation revisions. We re-wrote the flat plate PV
 simulation engine to reduce computational overhead and remove the
dependence on the TRNSYS engine. The new code runs nearly 10
 times faster than previous versions of SAM. This will reduce the
time required for parametric and other analyses that require
 multiple simulations. The new High-X Concentrating Photovoltaic
(HCPV) model is a new performance model that replaces the CPV
 option on the Module page. The new model includes CPV-specific
derate factors, an estimate of spectral effects, and is
 structured to allow us to improve the model as new data and
algorithms for CPV systems becomes available. We have created a
 set of new report templates for PV, wind, biopower, and geothermal
systems that show a summary of key inputs and results in a
 PDF document.</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic Models</h2>
 <p>Improved simulation engine for faster simulations. (see Summary above for details)</p>
 <p>Remove CPV model option from Module page, and replaced it with a new High-X Concentrating PV (HCPV) performance model. The
 new HCPV model includes CPV-specific derates, and air mass correction to simulate spectral effects.</p>
 <p>Rename Component-based PV model to Flat Plate PV model.</p>
 <p>Change azimuth angle convention for Flat Plate PV model to be consistent with PVWatts convention: 0=N, 90=E, 180=S, 270=W.
 If you use SAM 2012.5.11 to open a file you last saved in a previous version, SAM correctly converts the azimuth value for
 northern hemisphere locations only. For southern hemisphere locations, you should change the azimuth value yourself.</p>
 <p>Improve sun position calculations for Flat Plate PV model. This causes a small difference in the Flat Plate PV system output
 due to more accurate sun position calculation (ref comparison of TRNSYS to PVWatts sunpos calculation - PDF report from
 U.Wisc)</p>
 <p>Improved Flat Plate PV Backtracking algorithm. Simplified inputs significantly, improved runtime, results show better
 comparison with other tools (PVsyst)</p>
 <p>For the Flat Plate PV, CEC Performance Model with User Entered Specifications module model option, allow temperature
 coefficients to be entered either in A/degC, V/degC, or %/degC.</p>
 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Improved usability of P50/P90 simulation option. Report P50/P90 values for all results shown in the Metricsd table on the
 Results page.</p>
 <p>Developed new report templates for PV, biopower, wind, and geothermal systems.</p>
 <p>Improved web update system to add automatic notification when software updates are available.</p>
 <p>Added Library() function in SamUL to query library types and entry names. One application of the function is to
 run through different modules in one of the PV module libraries.</p>
 <h2>Biomass Power</h2>
 <p>Some Input pages rearranged and streamlined for clarity.</p>
 <p>Changed Emissions Comparison page to Life-Cycle Impacts page.
 The new page allows users to see the emission effects of
 transportation fuel, transportation mode, and pre-processing method.
 The overall greenhouse gas emissions results are displayed
 graphically, broken into general categories such as transportation,
collection, combustion, and biomass uptake. This page does
 not affect the performance or cost model in any way. It is purely
informational.</p>
 <p>Removed the option to specify biomass power plant capacity. This option was confusing to users, since intuitively, this
 option would back-calculate the amount of biomass used to achieve a plant of the specified size and the corresponding
 collection radius. The back-calculation of feedstock radius is not a current capability of SAM Biopower.</p>
 <h2>Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) Models</h2>
 <p>Fixed stow angle bug in empirical trough model. Should not affect results unless stow angles were set to an angle much less
 than 180 .</p>
 <p>Thermal storage tank heater efficiency was not being applied to tank heater parasitic losses. This should have minimal
 impact on results for most cases because tank heater is typically not frequently used and default heater efficiency is
 0.99.</p>
 <p>Fixed thermal storage tank freeze protection calculations. Impact on annual performance results should be negligible.</p>
 <p>Optical efficiency did not include cosine effects. Modified version will significantly change optical efficiency results.
 Annual energy is not affected.</p>
 <p>Fix field defocus calculation for physical trough and molten salt power tower models. Impact on gross and net annual energy
 is negligible. May have larger impact (~5%) on the energy from the field in some cases.</p>
 <p>Fix bug in empirical trough model that allowed storage to over-discharge under some conditions. Impact on annual energy
 should be negligible.</p>
 <p>Fix bug in freeze protection calculations for the physical trough model. Impact should be negligible for systems with low
 freeze protection loads. Systems with higher freeze protection loads may see a noticeable decrease in required freeze
 protection energy.</p>
 <h2>Wind</h2>
 <p>Consolidate small-scale and large-scale wind models into a single Wind Power model that uses the swrf wind data format and
 files from the Western Wind Dataset.</p>
 <h1>Version 2011.12.2 December 2011 (Update)</h1>
 <p>SAM 2011.12.2 is a maintenance update that addresses a few issues with the previous version including:</p>
 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Error when opening zsam files by double-clicking the file name</p>
 <p>Issue with power tower models in Mac version.</p>
 <p>Handling of PV soiling derating factors when opening files created in older versions.</p>
 <p>For a full description of new features in this version, see the SAM 2011.11.29 description below.</p>
 <h1>Version 2011.11.29 November 2011</h1>
 <p>SAM 2011.11.29 adds three new technologies and several tools and capabilities, in addition to bug fixes, usability
 improvements, and documentation revisions (see below for detailed descriptions):</p>
 <h2>New technologies</h2>
 <p>CSP Linear Fresnel</p>
 <p>CSP Direct Steam Power Tower</p>
 <p>Biomass Power</p>
 <h2>New capabilities</h2>
 <p>Model PV modules with spec sheet data</p>
 <p>Monthly soiling derates for PV systems</p>
 <p>P50/P90 analysis</p>
 <p>Model a generic system using hourly or sub-hourly generation profile as input</p>
 <h2>New tools</h2>
 <p>Integrated time series data viewer</p>
 <p>Report Generator</p>
 <p>Case Compare</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic Component-based</h2>
 <p>Ground Reflectance (albedo): Removed ground reflectance with snow
 input (albedo w/ snow) from the Array page. If the weather
 file contains valid albedo values between 0 and 1, they are in the
simulation. Otherwise, the single ground reflectance value
 from the Array page is used. When comparing results from the current
 version with older versions of SAM, for locations that
 experience snowfall, a weather file format that includes snow depth,
 (Boulder CO.tm2 for example), and the default ground
 reflectance inputs, the annual output predicted by the current
version will be typically slightly lower than the output
 predicted by older versions. Older versions of SAM predicted higher
system output during snow cover periods by assuming that
 all PV panels would be cleared of snow, and that the more reflective
 ground would reflect more diffuse radiation onto the
 panels. The current version does not make this assumption for the PV
 component based models, but rather limits the input to a
 single average ground reflectance input.</p>
 <p>Tilted Surface Irradiation Models: Removed the Hay and Davies, and Perez 1988 diffuse irradiation models options from the 
 Array page. This change simplifies the user interface while keeping
the Isotropic, HDKR, and Perez 1990 models available.If you
 open a SAM file created with an older version of SAM and using the
old Hay and Davies option, SAM will change the setting to
 the HDKR option in the new version . Similarly, the Perez 1988
option from the old version upgrades to the Perez 1990 option in
 the new version. The HDKR model typically will predict slightly
higher diffuse irradiation on a tilted surface than the Hay
 and Davies model because of its treatment of additional diffuse
irradiation components. The Perez 1990 model is based on
 coefficients extracted from a larger input dataset than the Perez
1988 model.</p>
 <p>Irradiance Component Input Option: Removed the option on the
Array page for using total (global) horizontal and diffuse
 components of irradiation. The current options are total and beam,
and beam and diffuse. By default, SAM uses beam and diffuse
 from the weather file. There should be no difference in results
between the current version and older versions for weather file
 with self-consistent irradiance values. This change simplifies the
user interface while still providing sufficient options for
 nearly all modeling needs.</p>
 <p>Soiling: Added an option for entering monthly soiling derates.
The derate is applied equally to all components of the
 calculated plane-of-array (POA) irradiance before the DC module
power is calculated. This is different from previous versions
 of SAM, in which the soiling derate was applied to the DC output of
the module. The new approach is more consistent with real
 systems, where soiling blocks irradiance before reaching the module,
 which both reduces POA irradiance and affects cell
 operating temperature. The approach in the new version tends to
slightly reduce the system's annual output compared to the
 approach in older versions, assuming a constant soiling derate for
all months.</p>
 <p>Shading: Added an option to import Solar Pathfinder Month x Hour or Obstruction table shading input files.</p>
 <p>PV Module Model: Added a CEC Performance Model with User Entered Specifications option on the Module page. This model
 allows the user to enter module datasheet specifications directly into SAM, which calculates coefficients to drive the CEC
 performance model. The coefficients are calculated using a method detailed in the SAM help system.</p>
 <p>PV Databases: The CEC PV Module, Sandia Module, and Sandia Inverter databases were updated to the latest available
 versions.</p>
 <p>Monthly Soiling Derates: The PV Component-based model includes an option to specify 12 monthly values for the soiling derate
 factor on the Array page.</p>
 <p>Backtracking: The backtracking option in SAM was temporarily removed for this version because the SAM team did not have
 confidence that it was working correctly in all configurations. We are developing an updated algorithm and expect it to be
 faster and easier to use for future versions of SAM.</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaic PVWatts</h2>
 <p>Cell Temperature: PVWatts in SAM now reports cell temperature as equal to ambient temperature (dry bulb) when the sun is
 down. Previous versions reported 999 during non-solar hours. This change has no impact on results.</p>
 <p>Handling of Snow Depth: PVWatts in SAM now uses the snow depth
data in a TMY2 weather file (if available) to adjust the
 ground reflectance (albedo) from 0.2 (no snow) to 0.6 (with snow
cover). This change makes the results match the online PVWatts
 V.1 exactly for TMY2 files. When comparing results with previous
versions of SAM, for locations with measured snow cover, this
 change will typically increase the annual output from a system
because snow cover hours will reflect more diffuse irradiance
 from the ground surface onto the panels. This assumes that panels
are always cleared of snow.</p>
 <h2>Physical Trough System</h2>
 <p>Improved the iterative solution algorithm for solar field mass
flow rate. The previous release used the
 successive-substitution method for determining convergence of the
HTF mass flow rate in the solar field. While generally
 successful, this method is prone to error in situations where the
initial guess values do not closely resemble the final
 converged solution. This release uses the hybrid false-position 
iterative method which has proved to be significantly more
 robust and stable than the previous method in solving for the solar
field mass flow rate. The modified solver algorithm also
 allowed us to place thermal inertia and heat loss calculations
inside of the primary iteration loop, thus improving the
 accuracy of the solar field calculations and reducing solver time.
Potential impacts include: This is the most significant
 modification to the solar field algorithm in this release. The more
accurate solver ensures energy/mass/temperature balance in
 a wider range of operating conditions, and thus impacts the annual
and hourly energy production. The net impact was shown to
 slightly reduce annual energy output and have a varying effect on
individual time step calculations.</p>
 <p>Adjusted the design-point mass flow rate in the solar field to
more correctly calculate the absorbed thermal energy and
 thermal losses from the loop at design. This change slightly
increases the thermal performance of the solar field according to
 the design-point calculations, thus setting the design mass flow
rate to a higher value. Potential impacts include: Defocusing
 of the solar field caused by mass flow exceeding its maximum limit
will occur less frequently. The design-point mass flow rate
 is also used to size the piping and header diameters. This change
leads to potentially slightly larger diameter piping,
 increasing the thermal inertia of the modeled plant, increasing the
piping thermal losses, and decreasing the pumping parasitic
 through the headers.</p>
 <p>Updated pipe diameter sizing algorithm to correctly handle systems where the number of SCAs in the loop is 1 or 2 (8 is the
 default value). Potential impacts include: Addresses a bug causing the simulation to crash in this scenario.</p>
 <p>Correction to header piping length calculation. Potential impacts include: The piping length was calculated to be
 artificially low. This fix correctly calculates the header length, thus impacting the thermal inertia of the solar field and
 piping thermal heat losses. The net effect of this changed was observed to decrease the annual energy production for the
 default system.</p>
 <p>Added an algorithm to the solar field model that avoids recalculating the solar field during multiple iterations if the
 inputs to the module do not change. Potential impacts include: Improved simulation speed, no changes to performance
 calculations are anticipated.</p>
 <p>Correction to the calculation of optical efficiency during the
first and last hour of the day in which the solar field
 operates. Potential impacts include: This fix applies only to
simulations with sub-hourly time steps. During this type of
 simulation, thermal energy produced during the first and last time
step of solar field operation is reduced slightly, depending
 on the time step duration.</p>
 <p>Optical end loss (light reflected at an angle off the end of
the last collector in a row that is not absorbed) was
 previously applied as an average optical loss to each collector in
the loop. The code was updated to apply this loss to only
 the relevant collectors in the loop. Potential impacts include:
Total solar field optical efficiency is unchanged, though the
 energy absorbed by each collector will be distributed slightly
differently. This slightly impacts thermal losses from the
 receivers, but is likely unnoticeable in annual simulation results.</p>
 <p>Improved the solar field freeze protection algorithm. The
previous release assumed that freeze protection would be applied
 locally in the calculations for the solar field to maintain the HTF
at the desired freeze-protection temperature. In other
 words, the freeze protection was (unrealistically) injected into
any given calculation node in the solar field that fell
 below the minimum temperature. The model was updated to a predictive
 algorithm that applies fossil backup to heat the HTF at
 the inlet of the solar field to a sufficient temperature such that
the HTF exiting the loop matches the desired freeze
 protection temperature. This more accurately captures thermal losses
 in the circulating fluid and the required energy
 contribution from the auxiliary fossil boiler. Potential impacts
include: Improved accuracy in freeze protection calculations,
 including thermal losses and fossil energy requirement.</p>
 <p>Updated pressure loss calculation in the hot and cold headers to scale more accurately with mass flow rate. Potential
 impacts include: Reduced pumping parasitic requirement at part-load operation.</p>
 <p>Improved evacuated tube receiver thermal loss model to account for the temperature gradient across the SCA instead of
 calculating the thermal losses at an average temperature only. Potential impacts include: Improved accuracy in thermal loss
 calculations for the solar field receivers.</p>
 <p>Removed the minimum power cycle restart requirement. The functionality of this value was compromised by the turbine startup
 time requirement and the turbine startup energy requirement, and thus is no longer necessary. Potential impacts include:
 None</p>
 <p>Corrected a bug in the thermal storage system that allowed a negative mass in the tank under some conditions. This caused
 the simulation to crash. Potential impacts include: No performance impacts. Reduced likelihood of simulation crash in some
 situations.</p>
 <p>Corrected the calculation for thermal load into the power block
during standby mode operation. The previous release
 underestimated the thermal requirement to maintain standby
operation. Potential impacts include: Increased thermal requirement
 during standby operation (if applicable). Impact is expected to be
minimal for most cases.</p>
 <p>Improved steam property lookup accuracy. Potential impacts include: Improved convergence of steam property calls and
 calculation of steam-related values such as heat rejection evaporative loss and power cycle water blowdown loss.</p>
 <h2>Power Tower System</h2>
 <p>Implemented a bug fix for calculating heliostat efficiency at
negative solar azimuth angles. The previous release used the
 heliostat field component from the TRNSYS STEC library to
interpolate solar field efficiency from a matrix defined by solar
 azimuth and zenith angles which artificially limited the solar
azimuth angle to zero. The TRNSYS definition for solar azimuth
 angles applies a range of -180 deg to +180 deg (North to North,
clockwise), thus the solar field efficiency was incorrectly
 interpolated at an azimuth angle of 0 deg for all solar azimuth angles
less than zero (morning hours). Potential impacts include:
 Solar field optical efficiency was over-estimated for most systems
during morning hours, resulting in an annual over-estimate
 of approximately 3% for the default external receiver system and 5%
for the default cavity-north system. This is the most
 significant modification in the tower models for this release.</p>
 <p>Added outputs to report HTF pressure drop across the receiver. Potential impacts include: The user is now able to review the
 HTF pressure drop, including gravity and frictional head loss.</p>
 <p>Removed the minimum power cycle restart requirement. The functionality of this value was compromised by the turbine startup
 time requirement and the turbine startup energy requirement, and thus is no longer necessary. Potential impacts include:
 None</p>
 <p>Corrected a bug in the thermal storage system that allowed a negative mass in the tank under some conditions. This caused
 the simulation to crash. Potential impacts include: No performance impacts. Reduced likelihood of simulation crash in some
 situations.</p>
 <p>Corrected the calculation for thermal load into the power block
during standby mode operation. The previous release
 underestimated the thermal requirement to maintain standby
operation. Potential impacts include: Increased thermal requirement
 during standby operation (if applicable). Impact is expected to be
minimal for most cases.</p>
 <p>Improved steam property lookup accuracy. Potential impacts include: Improved convergence of steam property calls and
 calculation of steam-related values such as heat rejection evaporative loss and power cycle water blowdown loss.</p>
 <h2>Generic Solar System</h2>
 <p>Updated the optical table interpolation algorithm to allow simultaneous interpolation of multiple tables. This change was
 made to support the Linear Fresnel system, which also uses the algorithm developed within the GSS model. Potential impacts
 include: No performance impacts are expected.</p>
 <p>Improved performance calculations to determine the design-point
solar field optical efficiency based on the actual solar
 zenith at solar noon on the summer solstice. This allows the model
to choose a more representative design-point mass flow rate.
 Potential impacts include: Minimal changes to the annual energy
production.</p>
 <h2>Generic System</h2>
 <p>SAM's Generic System model now allows you to provide either hourly generation data or sub-hourly data with up to
 one-minute resolution as input, which makes it possible to use results from an external performance model with SAM's
 financial models.</p>
 <h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>
 <p>Collector Specification: Updated simulator to correctly use number of collectors specified by user. Also made collector
 database on user interface searchable.</p>

 <p>Added the power block component, which to allow for modeling of a geothermal system using SAM's power block
 component.</p>
 <h2>Biomass Power</h2>
 <p>The utility-scale biopower model was developed by the SAM team with internal funding from NREL. The model accesses online
 NREL databases of biomass resource to model a biopower plant.</p>
 <h2>Tools</h2>
 <p>Integrated time series data viewer. SAM's new Time Series Data
Viewer replaces DView for displaying graphs of time
 series data. The new viewer is integrated into the user interface,
and runs on both Windows and Mac OS versions of SAM. DView
 is still available in SAM via the Results menu.</p>
 <p>Report Generator. The new report generator allows you to design
and generate reports in PDF format with tables of both input
 data and results, along with text, and images. Once you design a
report template, you can use it with different SAM files. This
 should facilitate generating reports for project reports.</p>
 <p>Case Compare. The Case Comparison window shows inputs and results from all of the cases in a file in a single, editable
 table. You can quickly identify differences between cases, and update values of inputs directly from the window.</p>
 <p>Search Box: For inputs that use a list to populate values (weather file, PV modules and inverters), a search box makes it
 possible to type a few characters of the input name.</p>
 <h2>Cost and Financing</h2>
 <p>Land Cost for Solar Systems: The land cost category on the System Costs page for PV and CSP systems is now linked to the
 land area input on the Array or Solar Field page.</p>
 <h2>Weather Files</h2>

 <p>This version includes updated default input values across all technologies and several bug fixes.</p>
 <h2>Financing</h2>
 <p>Reorganize and rename financing options in the Technology and Market window: The Utility Independent Power Producer (IPP)
 option is equivalent to the Utility IPP options in pre-2011.5.4 versions of SAM, and the new utility financing options are
 listed under the Advanced Utility IPP Options heading.</p>
 <p>Removed the mid quarter MACRS depreciation option from the Utility IPP and Commercial PPA options.</p>
 <p>Added a custom depreciation option for the new utility financing options to facilitate analysis of depreciation schedules
 other than those typically available under U.S. tax law.</p>
 <p>Corrected a problem with the units in the Production Tax Credit calculation that affected analyses involving the PTC. SAM
 2011.5.23 and earlier incorrectly overestimated the PTC amount by a factor of 1000.</p>
 <p>Fixed convergence issues in the PPA price calculation algorithm in the Utility IPP and Commercial PPA models when used with
 Wind, Generic, and PVWatts system models.</p>

 <p>Added PDF export for single graphs.</p>
 <p>Corrected a problem with SAM window placement on a multiple monitor setup.</p>

 value of one of the linked variables instead of using long labels that include all variable names and values.</p>
 <p>Added a search box to selection windows such as the Choose Parametrics window. You can now type a few characters of a
 variable name to find it in the list.</p>

 <p>This version addresses a problem with the PV operation and maintenance default values and includes some formatting changes to the Help
 system.</p>
 <h1>Version 2011.5.4 May 2011</h1>
 <p>This version adds many new features in addition to fixing bugs in
 existing models. It adds several new utility scale
 financing models that more accurately represent some common
financial structures used for renewable energy projects than SAM's
 original Utility-IPP model. Other improvements include a generic
system model that can accept hourly energy input from other
 models, enhanced temperature correction algorithms for the CEC PV
module model for various mounting options, more detailed
 accounting for PV cost details, a new model for calculating
geothermal co-production in conjunction with an oil or gas well,
 and a utility scale wind model that can directly access a large
database of hourly wind data at various hub heights.</p>
 <h2>General New Features</h2>

 <p>Updated reference manual for scripting (SamUL)</p>
 <h2>Financial Models</h2>
 <p>Added an All Equity Partnership Flip financing structure that
represents a power generation project with a tax investor
 and developer and no debt. You specify a target IRR and year or
target PPA price with the allocation of cash and tax benefits
 to each partner before and after the target year. SAM calculates the
 project PPA price and the NPV and IRR for each
 partner.</p>
 <p>Added a Leveraged Partnership Flip financing structure that
represents a power generation project with a tax investor and
 developer and debt. You specify a target IRR and year or target PPA
price with the allocation of cash and tax benefits to each
 partner before and after the target year. SAM calculates the project
 PPA price and the NPV and IRR for each partner.</p>
 <p>Added a Sale Leaseback financing structure that represents a
power generation project with two partners. The tax investor
 purchases the project from the developer and leases it back to the
developer. The tax investor receives lease payments from the
 developer along with tax benefits and incentives. The developer
keeps any excess cash flow after operating costs and lease
 payments are made. You specify a target IRR and year or target PPA
price and lease terms. SAM calculates the project PPA price
 and the NPV and IRR for each partner.</p>
 <p>Added a Single Owner financing structure that represents a
power generation project with one owner. The owner receives all
 of the cash and tax benefits from the project. The owner may be the
original project developer or a third party investor if the
 developer is unable to use the tax benefits or lacks sufficient
capital to construct the project. You specify debt terms, and a
 target IRR and year or target PPA price. SAM calculates the project
PPA price, IRR and NPV.</p>
 <p>Merged Residential Cash and Residential Loan/Mortgage financing options into single Residential model. To model cash
 financing, set the debt fraction to zero.</p>
 <p>Merged Commercial Cash and Commercial Loan financing options into a single Commercial model. To model cash financing,
 set the debt fraction to zero.</p>
 <p>Renamed Third Party Ownership to Commercial PPA to better reflect calculations. User can now specify either the IRR
 target or the First Year PPA price and solve for the other.</p>
 <p>Merged Utility IPP , Utility Dispatch , and Utility Bid Price options into single Independent Power Producer option
 that handles all three cases. The user can specify the IRR target or the First Year PPA price, along with time-dependent
 valuation factors (dispatch).</p>
 <p>Simplified inputs for tax credits and incentives to remove unnecessary complexity.</p>
 <p>Handling of property tax fixed. Previous versions overemphasized the valuation of property taxes, and an improved method is
 implemented.</p>
 <h2>Weather Data</h2>
 <p>Bug fix for copy/paste into TMY3 creator wizard on Mac OS X</p>
 <h2>Photovoltaics</h2>
 <p>Updated CEC and Sandia module databases to most recent available versions.</p>

 <h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>
 <p>Added a database of SRCC solar thermal collectors.</p>
 <p>Added input for maximum auxiliary power to allow for modeling of larger systems</p>
 <p>Added input for circulation pump power</p>
 <h2>Parabolic Trough (Physical)</h2>
 <p>The solar field inlet HTF temperature calculation was corrected
to better model plant behavior during shutdown. Previously,
 the field inlet temperature remained tied to the power block outlet
temperature when the solar field was not producing power,
 but thermal storage was providing energy for power cycle operation.
This prevented accurate modeling of nighttime solar field
 cool down behavior. Potential impacts include: Observed field
inlet/outlet temperature during nighttime operation for systems
 with thermal storage or auxiliary fossil backup, required solar
field startup energy</p>
 <p>The pipe sizing algorithm was modified to match calculated piping
 diameters to a common piping schedule. The piping schedule
 is now selected based on the minimum available schedule diameter
that exceeds the calculated diameter requirement. Potential
 impacts include: Piping thermal loss, piping pressure drop and
parasitic power requirement, solar field thermal inertia (from
 modified piping HTF volume calculation)</p>
 <p>The field piping thermal inertia term on the Power Cycle page was split into three separate inertia terms and moved to the
 Solar Field page. The new inputs include specific thermal inertia terms for the cold header piping, hot header piping, and
 collector loop piping. Potential impacts include: Solar field transient behavior during startup and shutdown</p>
 <p>The convergence tolerance on the solar field and controller
algorithms was tightened. The former tolerance values proved to
 be insufficient for simulations with sub-hourly time steps.
Potential impacts include: Annual energy output, longer simulation
 time</p>
 <p>An error in the collector loop HTF temperature calculation was corrected. The error related to the fraction of energy
 involved in warming/cooling the HTF during non-steady-state operation. Potential impacts include: Transient behavior during
 startup, shutdown, and rapidly changing DNI levels</p>
 <p>The mass flow rate calculation within the solar field was
improved. Previously, it was possible for the mass flow rate to
 indicate convergence with small remaining convergence error in the
field energy balance. The improved calculation eliminates
 this error. Potential impacts include: Small differences in the
solar field mass flow rate or thermal energy output</p>
 <p>On the Thermal Storage page, an input was added for the Hot tank
heater set point. This allows the tank model to maintain a
 temperature set point for the auxiliary heater for both the cold and
 hot storage tanks separately. Potential impacts include:
 Differences in predicted tank heater parasitics, difference in
thermal energy storage performance throughout the year</p>
 <p>On the Power Cycle page, an input was added for the Minimum power block restart time. This input allows the user to control
 the amount of time that the power cycle will require to resume producing electricity if the cycle trips during daytime
 operation because of low solar resource. Potential impacts include: Annual electricity production, electricity production on
 partially cloudy days</p>
 <p>On the Power Cycle page, an input was added for the Turbine inlet
 pressure control method. This allows the user to select
 the power cycle performance model as either fixed pressure or
floating pressure. Previously, only fixed pressure operation was
 modeled. Potential impacts include: None for fixed pressure mode;
For floating pressure mode - power cycle performance during
 part load operation, power cycle outlet temperature during thermal
storage discharge</p>
 <p>On the Thermal Storage page, an input was added to allow the user
 to select the auxiliary fossil backup dispatch mode.
 Options now include Minimum backup level, and Supplemental
operation. Previously, only the Minimum backup level mode was
 included. The Supplemental operation mode allows fossil backup to
provide thermal energy to the system in addition to thermal
 energy provided by the solar field or TES. The maximum rate of
energy delivery is the fraction of design point power specified
 in the Fossil Fill Fraction inputs under the Thermal Storage
Dispatch Control group, and the total fossil contribution plus the
 energy from the field and TES cannot exceed the corresponding Turbine
 Output Fraction value. Potential impacts include: None for
 Minimum backup level. For supplemental operation modified fossil
backup control</p>
 <p>The solar field defocusing algorithm was modified to more
accurately model field defocusing during over-design operation.
 Modifications improved the model's ability to avoid excessive
defocusing and reduce dumped energy during over-design operation.
 These changes are most prominent in systems where frequent
defocusing is required. Potential impacts include: Annual
 electricity output, solar field performance during over-design
operation, dumped thermal energy, model convergence issues</p>
 <p>The measure for power cycle over-design operation within the
model was changed from total thermal energy input to HTF mass
 flow rate. This change reduces instances of excessive HTF mass flow
rate through the power cycle and more accurately simulates
 real plant operation strategies. Potential impacts include: Observed
 power block HTF mass flow rate, peak electric power
 generation</p>
 <p>The solar field inlet HTF temperature calculation was corrected
to better model plant behavior during shutdown. Previously,
 the field inlet temperature remained tied to the power block outlet
temperature when the solar field was not producing power,
 but thermal storage was providing energy for power cycle operation.
This prevented accurate modeling of nighttime solar field
 cool down behavior. Potential impacts include: Observed field
inlet/outlet temperature during nighttime operation for systems
 with thermal storage or auxiliary fossil backup, required solar
field startup energy</p>
 <p>The field configuration option on the Solar Field page was
modified to allow the user to specify the number of subfields
 rather than the configurations I or H . This change improves the
model's ability to capture the piping performance of a
 wider range of field layouts. Along with this change, internal
piping layout algorithms were updated to accommodate the range
 of subfield selections. Potential impacts include: Piping thermal
loss, piping pressure drop and parasitic power requirement,
 solar field thermal inertia (from modified piping HTF volume
calculation)</p>
 <h2>Parabolic Trough (Empirical)</h2>
 <p>The startup criteria in the plant control algorithm incorrectly
restricted startup to conditions above the power cycle
 dispatch requirement, when startup should have been allowed above
the minimum power block operation level. This problem was
 corrected to represent a more realistic startup procedure. Potential
 impacts include: Small impact on annual energy production,
 small impact on electricity output during morning operation</p>
 <h2>Power Tower</h2>
 <p>The existing control strategy encompassing all plant operation
and dispatch decisions was deemed to be limited in
 flexibility and prone to convergence errors. To improve the tower
model and ensure a common simulation platform for all CSP
 models, the previous control algorithm was replaced by the algorithm
 developed for the Physical Trough model. This switch has
 significant benefits in ensuring the quality of the results over a
wide input variable space, and provides improved results
 especially in simulation cases where solar multiple, thermal storage
 sizing, or auxiliary fossil backup sizing deviate
 significantly from the optimal. This modification applies to both
the external and cavity receiver models. Potential
 impacts include: Improved solar field defocusing control, improved
plant startup behavior, improved thermal storage or
 auxiliary fossil backup dispatch control, increased annual
electricity output especially for systems with no storage</p>
 <p>Added fossil dispatch control scheme option on the Thermal Storage page. Refer to the Physical Trough release notes</p>
 <p>The pumping power requirement for HTF passing through the power
block was previously calculated on a thermal power basis 
 meaning the total thermal power passing through the pump was used to
 calculate an estimated electrical pumping power
 requirement. This calculation was replaced by an estimate on a mass
flow basis, where total pumping power is given in terms of
 kJ per kg of HTF (equivalently kW per kg/s of mass flow). This
change makes the tower model consistent with the pumping power
 convention for the parabolic trough model. Potential impacts
include: Modified parasitic pumping power for HTF through the
 TES/Power Cycle system</p>
 <p>Added sliding pressure operation for the power cycle. Refer to the Physical Trough release notes</p>
 <p>An error in the natural convection thermal loss calculation used the wrong temperature value for the conductivity of air. A
 second error in the calculation used the wrong active area for convection between the tube wall and the HTF. Both were
 corrected and resulted in a minor difference in annual energy production. Potential impacts include: Small difference in
 thermal losses from the external receiver.</p>
 <h2>Wind Systems</h2>
 <p>Addition of utility scale wind model. The SAM team has added a
utility scale wind option for SAM users. The new option uses
 the same algorithm to determine wind farm output (including a simple
 wake analysis), but provides a new list of turbines, new
 financing options, and a new source for wind resource data. The new
wind resource data is more granular in coverage and
 provides for measurements at hub heights more appropriate for
utility scale wind turbines.</p>
 <p>Added several hourly wind resource data files. More can be accessed via the online database connection that is integrated
 into SAM.</p>
 <p>Enhancements to the small scale wind turbine model. The small
scale model has been improved to run more quickly and some
 minor bugs have been addressed. In addition, new turbines have been
added to the Small Scale Wind turbine library, bringing the
 total to 16.</p>
 <h2>Geothermal</h2>
 <p>Addition of geothermal co-produced electricity model. The
Co-Production model in SAM estimates power output from
 co-production resources based on the resource temperature and flow
rate and the power plant model chosen. The power plant model
 calculates the plant net power output based on either the thermal
efficiency or utilization efficiency assumed for the power
 plant.</p>
 <h2>Generic Model</h2>
 <p>Can accept hourly energy production values as input, calculated by an external model.</p>
 <h1>Version 2010.10.8 October 2010</h1>
 <p>This version adds many new features in addition to making
improvements to existing ones. It adds a non-solar technology

 use of energy payment allocation factors for utility
 projects. This version allows modeling of two new utility financing
options. For PV systems, this version adds a more

 <h1>Version 2010.4.12 April 2010 (Update)</h1>
 <h2>This update corrects several issues with SAM 2010.3.31.:</h2>
 <p>System summary: Units for the total installed cost per capacity were incorrect for photovoltaic, solar water heating, and
 generic systems.</p>
 <p>Financing: Projects with commercial or utility financing and an analysis period less than the depreciation period caused
 simulations to fail. (This was also true for previous versions.)</p>
 <p>Incentives: Production-based incentives (PBI), production tax credits (PTC), and investment tax credits (ITC) were
 incorrectly calculated.</p>
 <p>Photovoltaic systems: The annual energy production was incorrect for systems with bipolar inverters from the Sandia inverter
 database.
 <br>Solar water heating: System energy savings were incorrectly calculated.</p>
 <p>Parabolic trough (physical): Receiver heat loss calculation was incorrect for receivers with lost vacuum or hydrogen
 leakage.</p>
 <p>Power tower: Water usage was incorrectly reported, values of the solar field delivered energy and power block input energy
 were incorrectly reported in the hourly results worksheet, and default values of some input variables were incorrect.</p>
 <p>Parabolic trough and power tower: Power block capacity-based costs were incorrectly calculated based on the net capacity
 instead of the gross capacity.</p>
 <h2>The update includes the following improvements:</h2>
 <p>Several new functions and improvements to the SamUL scripting language, including the ability to run scripts from the
 command line.</p>
