# System Advisor Model (SAM)
![Build](https://github.com/NREL/SAM/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

The SAM Open Source Project repository contains the source code, tools, and instructions to build a desktop version of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model™ (SAM™). SAM is a simulation program for electricity generation projects. It has models for different kinds of renewable energy systems and financial models for residential, commercial, and utility-scale projects. For more details about SAM's capabilities, see the SAM website at [https://sam.nrel.gov/](https://sam.nrel.gov/).

For a short video describing the SAM repositories, see https://youtu.be/E5z1iiZfZ3M.

The [SAM release notes](https://nrel.github.io/SAM/doc/releasenotes.html) are in https://github.com/NREL/SAM/blob/gh-pages/doc/releasenotes.html.

The desktop version of SAM for Windows, Mac, or Linux builds from the following open source projects:

* [SSC](https://github.com/nrel/ssc) is a set of "compute modules" that simulate different kinds of power systems and financial structures. It can be run directly using the [SAM Software Development Kit](https://sam.nrel.gov/sdk). **This is the source code for SAM's models, and is the repository to use for researching the algorithms underlying the models.**

* [LK](https://github.com/nrel/lk) is a scripting language that is integrated into SAM. SAM's user interface uses LK to calculate values to display on input pages. The user interface includes a script editor that allows users to write their own scripts from the user interface.

* [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) is a cross-platform graphical user interface platform used for SAM's user interface, and for the development tools included with SSC (SDKtool) and LK (LKscript).

* [WEX](https://github.com/nrel/wex) is a set of extensions to wxWidgets for custom user-interface elements developed specifically for SAM, LK script, and DView.

* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) is a C++ test framework that enables comprehensive unit-testing of software.  Contributions to the project will eventually be required to have associated unit tests written in this framework.

* [jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) is a C++ library that allows manipulating JSON values, including serialization and deserialization to and from strings.

* [Python](https://www.python.org)/[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/) is for integration of Python scripts with the SAM user interface.

This repository, **SAM**, contains the code for SAM's user interface that assigns values to inputs of the SSC compute modules, runs the modules in the correct order, and displays simulation results. It also includes tools for editing LK scripts, viewing time series results, and generating shade data from a 3-dimensional representation of a photovoltaic array or solar hot water collector and nearby shading objects.

The SAM repository also includes [two libraries](https://github.com/NREL/SAM/tree/develop/Sandia) from Sandia National Laboratories, [stepwise](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/packages/stepwise), and [LHS](https://dakota.sandia.gov/content/packages/lhs), which are distributed as part of the Dakota platform, licensed under [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).
