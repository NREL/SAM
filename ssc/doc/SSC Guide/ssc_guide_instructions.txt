This document explains how to use Doxygen, and LaTeX to create the SSC API documentation.

Overview
--------

Generating the SSC documentation involves a number of steps, some of which are automated, and some of which are automatic:

* The SSC documentation consists of the 8 chapters in the ssc_guide.tex file.

* The content for Chapters 1-7 is in ssc_guide.tex. It was originally drafted by Aron Dobos and revised by Paul Gilman.

* Doxygen generates content for Chapter 8 (the function reference for sscapi.h} in sscapi_8h.tex from comments in sscapi.h.

* An include command in the ssc_guide.tex file inserts the content of sscapi_8h.tex into ssc_guide.tex.

* The settings in the Doxygen configuration file ssc_api_doxyconfig determine what is included in the function reference: Only a single page with the function reference, LaTeX document rather than HTML, etc.

* TeXworks generates the final PDF document from LaTeX.


Overall Steps for Maintaining Documentation
-------------------------------------------

1. As needed, revise content in ssc_guide.tex and the Doxygen-formatted comments in sscapi.h.

2. Run Doxygen on ssc_api_doxyconfig to generate the sscapi_8h.tex document from Doxygen-formatted comments in the sscapi.h header file.

3. Run TeXworks on ssc_guide.tex to convert LaTex document to PDF. (Run it twice to generate TOC, cross references, etc.)


Notes
-----

* Run Doxygen on ssc_api_doxyconfig. Doxygen creates the ssc_api_latex folder. (You can delete the folder before running Doxygen.)

* Ignore doxygen.sty that doxygen creates in the in the ssc_api_latex folder, and use the custom doxygen.sty in the SVN repository instead. It removes numbering of individual functions, and a few other minor formatting changes.

* If you use the doxygen.sty file that doxygen automatically generates instead of the customized one, open doxygen.sty in a text editor, and comment out or delete the commands under "Setup fancy headings" so that the "Generated on date for SSC API by Doxygen" footer does not appear on pages.
