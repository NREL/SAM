Setting up gtest (Google Test) is a bit tricky.

1.) Clone google test repo from GitHub.  
2.) Define the environmental variable GTEST_ROOT=<google test install>/googletest/
3.) Open <GTEST_ROOT>/msvc/gtest-md.sln.  
    This is the solution with code generation set to multi-thread specific dlls, according to these links:

4.) Modify the project "gtest" to be built as a x64 bit project. By default, is only set for 32 bit
5.) Build the debug and release versions 

Incorporating gtest into the test project
1.) Modify any project that produces libraries that will be included to be compiled with the MDd (Multi-threaded Debug DLL) option within Properties/Configuration Properties/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library.
2.) Rebuild projects
3.) Modify includes directory to include <GTEST_ROOT>/include
4.) Modify linker libraries to include "gtest.lib" for release builds and "gtestd.lib" for debug builds.
5.) Modify linker library additional library directories to include paths to "gtest.lib", "gtestd.lib"
