Physical Trough,All Equity Partnership Flip,376683104,15.5216,12.3469,; Warning: IRR at end of analysis period is not a number (NaN). This can indicate that revenues are too low to cover costs, or that they are excessively high compared to costs. Warning: IRR in target year is not a number (NaN). This can indicate that revenues are too low to cover costs, or that they are excessively high compared to costs. Warning: NPV is $-1.26626e+08. A negative NPV indicates project costs are higher than revenues. Notice: The calculated field design mass flow rate of 2773.02 kg/s is greater than the maximum defined by the max single loop flow rate and number of loops (2172.00 kg/s).

This can indicate that revenues are too low to cover costs, or that they are excessively high compared to costs. Warning: IRR in target year is not a number (NaN). This can indicate that revenues are too low to cover costs, or that they are excessively high compared to costs. Warning: NPV is $-3.37775e+08.
