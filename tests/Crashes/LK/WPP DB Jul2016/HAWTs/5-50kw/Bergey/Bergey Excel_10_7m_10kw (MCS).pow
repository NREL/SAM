This is an up-graded version of an earlier Bergey design and gives nearly twice as much annual energy output as the older  Excel - S model.

3-bladed upwind turbine with tail fin. It is a fixed pitch design. There is no cut-out speed as the tail fin furls the turbine away from the wind at above about 16 m/s. Grid or battery connections is possible.

Tower heights range from 18m to 49m.

The turbine has been granted UK and US certification and the power curve shown here is taken from the certification test results. The tabular data only extends to 20 metres/sec. and so the data has been extrapolated linearly downwards beyond this.

The annual energy production in kw-hrs from the present program agrees closely with the data in the MCS test certificate."
