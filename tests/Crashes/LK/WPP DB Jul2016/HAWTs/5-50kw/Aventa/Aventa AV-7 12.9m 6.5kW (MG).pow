This 3-bladed Swiss HAWT is unusual in being designed for much lower wind speeds than most small turbines and is intended for use at mean wind speeds below 5 m/s.

At 4.5m/s, the annual energy production is claimed to be about 24,000 kW-hrs and, at 4 m/s, about 20,000 kW-hrs.

These claims have been checked by a low speed version of the present program where the output was calculated to be 18,875 kW-hrs at 4m/s and about 22,000 kW-hrs at 4.5m/s. The calculations were carried out for a Weibull parameter k of 1.5063 corresponding to a standard deviation of 68%. This is the figure used by Aventa and may be a reflection of the wind characteristics of Swiss winds.

The power curve and the claimed annual energy production figures seem reasonable and are consistent with one another."
