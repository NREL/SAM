3-bladed upwind turbine with tail fin furling. Furling action seems to set in at about 12 metres/sec.

Manufacturer's graph extended only to 14 metres/sec. Values up to 20 metres/sec by linear downward extrapolation on the assumption that the furling action continues to yaw the turbine away from the wind.

Manufacturer's data on energy production is conservative and about 75% of the predictions from this program but no details given on how the figures were obtained.
