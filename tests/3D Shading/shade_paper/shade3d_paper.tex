{\it 
This paper assesses three popular models for estimating shading losses on photovoltaic systems.  Several hypothetical and actual scenes are used to compare the loss predictions of the three dimensional shading scene calculators in the System Advisor Model, PVsyst, and PV*SOL tools.   Comparisons with measured shade blocking from a SunEye device are also made.  Results show some notable differences in hourly shade loss profiles among the studied tools, even for very simplistic geometries.  However, on a annual energy basis, the differences appear to cancel out to some degree and result in errors that are comparable to documented variations in energy predictions.  These outcomes demonstrate a need for further development and improvement of 3D shade calculators to reduce model prediction errors and variability.
