The Use Retail Rates option defines an electricity rate structure so that electricity delivered to the grid is sold at the PPA price, and electricity from the grid is purchased at retail rates defined by the rate structure. This assumes there is one meter to measure sales and a separate one to measure purchases. Choose this option when power to charge the battery is purchased at retail rates.

The Use PPA Price option treats power required to charge the battery or meet inverter nighttime load as negative power generation, which effectively reduces revenue from power sales at the PPA power price. Choose this option when power to charge the battery is purchased at the PPA price.
