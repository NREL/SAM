The battery model provides comprehensive modeling of lead-acid and lithium ion batteries for integration with PV systems, including monitoring of battery capacity, terminal voltage variation with current and charge state, thermal effects, and lifetime degradation.  A manual dispatch controller provides the ability to dispatch the battery to meet specific energy and power needs based on time-of-day and time-of-year.
