The liquid fraction is extracted and recirculated to the inlet of the solar field loop where it mixes with the subcooled liquid from the power cycle outlet. The saturated steam at the outlet of the boiler section does not recirculate, but instead passes into the dedicated superheater section where it continues to increase in temperature before entering the power cycle.</span></p>

<p class="p_Note"><span class="f_CHNote">Note.</span><span class="f_Note"> Take special care in selecting the number of boiler and superheater sections. The steam conditions at the outlet of the solar field depend on the ratio between the heat absorbed by the boiler and the superheater. As the heat absorbed in the superheater sections increases relative to the boiler sections, the outlet steam temperature will also increase beyond the design point. Consequently, the number of superheater modules should correspond to the desired thermal input in addition to the saturated steam produced by the boiler.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The isentropic efficiency of the feedwater and recirculation pump (if applicable) in the solar field.

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The amount of energy required to increase the working temperature of the solar field, per unit aperture area of the solar field. The thermal inertia term is used to model the startup and shutdown transient behavior of the solar field. During startup, the thermal energy produced by the solar field is reduced according to the energy that goes into heating the working fluid, receiver components, piping, fittings, and insulation. This input captures all of those aspects of transient startup in the solar field.</span></p>

This value is used to calculate estimated thermal losses from the solar field at design, and is not directly used in calculating the hourly performance for the annual simulation. The field inlet temperature is calculated during performance runs based on the power cycle conversion efficiency and the steam temperature at the inlet of the power cycle.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The estimated design-point steam outlet temperature from the solar field. The actual field outlet temperature is calculated in the performance runs based on the Loop flow configuration (once-through or recirculated boiler), the boiler outlet quality (for recirculated designs), collector performance, and flow rate constraints. The actual field outlet temperature during performance calculations is highly sensitive to the ratio of superheater to boiler aperture area, and consequently, the Field outlet temperature that you specify may differ substantially from the actual outlet temperature if care is not taken in selecting the correct number of superheater modules in the recirculated boiler design. Refer to the documentation on the number of boiler/superheater modules for more information.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName" style="page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;"><span class="f_VariableName">Boiler outlet steam quality</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For the recirculated boiler configuration, the boiler outlet steam quality is used to calculate the mass flow rate of steam in the boiler section.

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The steam pressure at the inlet of the turbine at design conditions. The actual steam pressure during the performance calculations will vary as a function of the steam mass flow rate into the power cycle. The minimum steam pressure is limited to 50% of the design-point rating.

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Note that the pressure at the inlet of the solar field is equal to the pressure at the inlet of the turbine plus the total pressure drop across the solar field. You should choose a turbine design-point pressure to maintain operable steam pressures at the solar field inlet. </span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The steam property algorithms currently used in the SAM performance runs limit the maximum steam pressure to 190 bar, and values exceeding this limit will be reset during the simulation. This limit has been known to cause convergence issues in cases where design-point pressures are too high or where the solar field is designed to frequently operate with mass flow rates significantly higher than the design-point flow rate on which the pressure drop relationship is based.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The temperature below which auxiliary fossil backup heat is supplied to the solar field to prevent water from freezing in the equipment. You should set this value such that a reasonable margin exists between activation of the electric heat trace freeze protection equipment and the actual freezing point of water.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName" style="page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;"><span class="f_VariableName">Stow wind speed, m/s</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The maximum allowable wind velocity before the collectors defocus and enter safety stow position. The solar field cannot produce thermal energy during time steps in which the ambient wind velocity exceeds this limit.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName" style="page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;"><span class="f_VariableName">Solar elevation for collector nighttime stow, deg</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The solar elevation angle (above the horizon) that sets the operational limit of the collector field in the evening hours. When the solar elevation angle falls below this value, the collector field will cease operation.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName" style="page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;"><span class="f_VariableName">Solar elevation for collector morning deploy, deg</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The solar elevation angel (above the horizon) that sets the operational limit of the collector field in the morning hours. When the solar elevation angle rises above this value, the collector field will begin operation.</span></p>
