<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The time step of the weather data file determines the time step of the simulation. For example, a weather file with hourly data will cause SAM to make a set of 8,760 calculations to estimate the system's output over a single year. A weather file with 15-minute weather data will cause SAM to make a set of 8,760 hours per year Ã— 4 time steps per hour = 35,040 calculations.</span></p>
<p class="p_Note"><span class="f_CHNote">Note.</span><span class="f_Note"> SAM's detailed photovoltaic, PVWatts, solar water heating, and physical trough performance models have been tested with sub-hourly weather data. The other models may not work with sub-hourly weather data.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For wind resource data (<a href="weather_format.htm#srw" class="topiclink">SRW</a>), the last two columns of the first header row indicate the time step in hours (1=hourly, 0.25=15-minute, etc.), and number of time steps (8,760 for hourly, 35,040 for 15-minute, etc.). The values in the header must match the number of rows.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For solar resource data (<a href="weather_format.htm#samcsv" class="topiclink">SAM CSV</a>), the weather file's time step depends on the number of weather data rows (not including the header rows) in the weather file. An hourly weather file should have 8,760 rows of data. A 15-minute weather file should have 35,640 rows. A sub-hourly weather file must have a Minute column indicating the time for sun angle calculations.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For solar resource data with an hourly time step, SAM assumes that the sun position at the midpoint of the hour (at 30 minutes past the hour for hourly data) applies to the entire time step, unless you provide an optional Minute column in the weather file. &nbsp;If you include an optional Minute column, SAM uses the minute value as the time for the sun position calculation instead of the midpoint of the hour. For sub-hourly data, the sun position for the time step is its position at the minute indicated in the Minute column. For the sunrise time step, the sun position is at the midpoint between sunrise time and the end of the time step. Similarly, for the sunset hour, the sun position is the midpoint between the beginning of the time step and sunset time. The air mass calculation uses the site elevation value from the weather file header and the solar zenith angle calculated for each time step.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM assumes that the first row of data in the weather file is for the time step beginning at 12 a.m. (midnight) on January 1, local standard time. For hourly data, the first row is for the hour ending at 1 a.m. on January 1. For 15-minute data, the first row is for the quarter hour ending at 1:15 a.m. on January 1. For financial model time-dependent calculations, January 1 is a Monday, weekdays are Monday through Friday, and weekends are Saturday and Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM does not account for leap years or for daylight savings time. </span></p>
