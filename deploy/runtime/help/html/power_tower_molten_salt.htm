<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">A power tower system (also called a central receiver system) is a type of concentrating solar power (CSP) system that consists of a heliostat field, tower and receiver, power block, and optional storage system. The field of flat, sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats focus direct normal solar radiation onto a receiver at the top of the tower, where a heat-transfer fluid is heated and pumped to the power block. The power block generates steam that drives a conventional steam turbine and generator to convert the thermal energy to electricity.</span></p>

SAM only considers air-side thermal resistance in the heat transfer model so that increasing the CO</span><span class="f_Text" style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: sub;">2</span><span class="f_Text"> mass flow rate, for example, won’t decrease the thermal resistance between the CO</span><span class="f_Text" style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: sub;">2</span><span class="f_Text"> and air. The air cooler is sized at design as a function of two user-defined inputs: air-to-CO</span><span class="f_Text" style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: sub;">2</span><span class="f_Text">-compressor-inlet temperature difference and fan power. This approach to calculating the physical size of the air cooler roughly approximates the off-design relationship between fan power and compressor inlet temperature, and therefore, cycle efficiency. To simplify the off-design optimization process, SAM assumes that the fan runs at the design power each timestep, and calcualtes the corresponding compressor inlet temperature. Future work may investigate optimization of the fan power assuming variable frequency drives (VFDs) and/or binary operation of parallel air coolers.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">At design point, SAM calculates the required recuperator UA that results in an optimized cycle efficiency that is equal to the user-defined cycle efficiency. Because this is a detailed first-principles model, setting the cycle efficiency constrains the temperature difference across the primary heat exchanger. Consequently, the cold molten salt return temperature is a dependent variable (as opposed to the steam Rankine model, where both cycle efficiency and cold return temperature can be independently selected). As such, the receiver and thermal energy storage models are governed by this calculated cold temperature rather than the used-defined design HTF outlet temperature. Efficient sCO</span><span class="f_Text" style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: sub;">2</span><span class="f_Text"> cycle designs tend to have much hotter HTF return temperatures than steam Rankine cycles, so it is important to understand the impact of this difference on the plant design. For example, the receiver flow path likely needs to be shorter (i.e. fewer panels), and thermal energy storage will be less energy dense as it operates over a small temperature difference. The optimization tool on the Power Cycle page calculates the optimal cycle design point parameters, including the HTF return temperature.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">At off-design points, the inputs to the power cycle model are hot HTF inlet temperature and mass flow rate, as well as the ambient temperature. SAM optimizes off-design efficiency as a function of compressor shaft speed, inlet pressure (assuming inventory control), and recompression fraction (if applicable). The optimization is constrained such that the HTF cold return temperature is equal to the design point HTF return temperature to help ensure that the power cycle model converges. NREL is currently studying the potential performance differences that may result in allowing the HTF return temperature to float.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">One known limitation of the sCO</span><span class="f_Text" style="font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: sub;">2</span><span class="f_Text"> power cycle model is that it is relatively slow for annual simulations because it solves and optimizes first-principles model multiple times for each per hourly time step. Future versions of the model may include pre-processor and regression strategies to speed up simulations. The model may have trouble converging at significant part load (&lt; 60% design). You can help avoid this problem by adjusting the minimum turbine operation input on the Power Cycle page to a value greater than 0.5. For plants designed to operate with thermal storage, this restriction shouldn’t significantly impact performance.</span></p>
