<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Annual energy is a measure of the total quantity of electricity generated by the system over a single year. SAM reports an Annual AC Energy value in the Metrics table on the <a href="summary.htm" class="topiclink">Summary</a> tab of the Results page, and annual energy line items in the Energy section of the cash flow on the <a href="cashflow.htm" class="topiclink">Cash Flow</a> tab.</span></p>
<p class="p_Note"><span class="f_CHNote">Notes.</span><span class="f_Note"> </span><br />

<span class="f_Note">SAM calculates annual energy value by adding up time series (hourly or subhourly) power values.</span><br />
<span class="f_Note">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class="f_Note">SAM calculates the monetary value of electricity delivered to the grid on a time step basis to account for time-dependent factors such as time-of-use rates for behind-the-meter projects, and time-of-delivery price multipliers or market prices for front-of-meter projects. The total annual electricity to/from grid results tell you about quantities of electricity, but not necessarily the monetary value of that electricity.</span><br />
<span class="f_Note">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class="f_Note">For the Solar Water Heating model, the annual energy is the electricity saved by the water heating system, assuming that the system replaces an electric water heating system.</span></p>
<h4 class="p_Heading4"><span class="f_Heading4">Annual AC Energy in the Metrics Table</span></h4>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The Annual AC Energy value in the Metrics table is electricity delivered by the system in Year 1 of its operation. Its value depends on the type of project you are modeling:</span></p>
<p class="p_List" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left: 24px; margin-left: 24px;"><span class="f_List" style="font-family: Arial,'Lucida Sans Unicode','Lucida Grande','Lucida Sans';display:inline-block;width:24px;margin-left:-24px">&#8226;</span><span class="f_List">For front-of-meter projects (PPA, Merchant Plant, Community Solar financial models), Annual AC Energy in Year 1 is the total net electricity delivered to the grid. This is the electricity sold by the project to earn revenue. It is the electricity generated by the system less any electricity purchased from the grid to charge batteries or for system loads such as photovoltaic inverter standby loads at night, or freeze protection loads in a concentrating solar power system (CSP).</span></p><p class="p_ListLast" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left: 24px; margin-left: 24px;"><span class="f_List" style="font-family: Arial,'Lucida Sans Unicode','Lucida Grande','Lucida Sans';display:inline-block;width:24px;margin-left:-24px">&#8226;</span><span class="f_ListLast">For behind-the-meter projects (Residential, Commercial, Third Party Ownership), Annual AC Energy in Year 1 is the total net electricity delivered to the grid and load. This is the electricity used to reduce the project owner's annual electricity bill. Electricity generated by the system may be delivered to a building or facility's electric loads, or it may be delivered to the grid in exchange for energy credits or dollar payments. It may also charge batteries or meet system loads such as for inverter nighttime consumption. Behind-the-meter projects may also purchase electricity from the grid to charge batteries or meet these loads.</span></p><h4 class="p_Heading4"><span class="f_Heading4">Cash Flow Energy Values</span></h4>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The Energy line items in the cash flow indicate the total electricity delivered to and received from the grid on an annual basis. These values are useful for estimating relative energy values, and for analyzing annual changes in energy over the analysis period. Annual changes in energy values may be caused by system degradation, battery degradation, battery replacements, or geothermal reservoir replacement.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The sum of AC electric power delivered to the grid in each time step over the year. Depending on the system design, this electricity may be generated by the system, discharged by the battery, or both.

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For front-of-meter projects, the PPA revenue, production-based incentives, and variable plant operation and maintenance costs are calculated from the time series &quot;to grid&quot; values. Because time-of-delivery price multipliers, market power prices, and escalation rates may apply, the annual revenue from electricity sales is not necessarily the product of a single power price and electricity to grid.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For behind-the-meter projects, the time series &quot;to grid&quot; values determine the value excess generation as defined on the Electricity Rates page, and of production-based incentives and variable plant operation and maintenance costs.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">This value may be useful for reference as a quick way to compare different systems, but SAM does not use it for any cost or revenue calculations.</span></p>
