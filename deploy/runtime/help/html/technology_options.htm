<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The <a href="detailed_photovoltaic_model.htm" class="topiclink">detailed photovoltaic model</a> calculates a grid-connected photovoltaic system's electrical output using separate module and inverter models. It requires module and inverter specifications along with information about the number of modules and inverters in the system. You can either provide your own module and inverter specifications from a manufacturer's data sheet, or choose a module and inverter from libraries. The detailed photovoltaic model models the effect of temperature on module performance, and has options for calculating shading and other losses in the system. The model also includes a system sizing calculator to help you determine the number of modules and inverters in the system.</span></p>

It models a grid-connected photovoltaic system using a few basic inputs to describe the system's nameplate capacity, array orientation and mounting type, and system losses. PVWatts makes internal assumptions about module and inverter characteristics for three types of modules. SAM's implementation of PVWatts includes options for modeling shading that are not available with the online version.</span></h4>

The physical trough model characterizes many of the system components from first principles of heat transfer and thermodynamics, rather than from empirical measurements as in the empirical trough system model. While the physical model is more flexible than the empirical model (see below), it adds more uncertainty to performance predictions than the empirical model.</span></p>
