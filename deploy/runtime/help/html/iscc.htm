<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) model simulates the coupled performance of a Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) hybridized with a molten salt power tower heat source. The model provides a high-level, conceptual understanding of how the power tower design and operation interacts with the NGCC design and operation. Because NGCC designs are highly variable and cycle operation is a function of many different signals, this model is only one representation out of many potential options.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The model contains two separate NGCC cycle models: one developed by NREL and one developed by GE. NREL's model was developed in IPSEpro and uses general information to define components, while GE's model was developed in Thermoflow and uses GE's in-house component performance and operation models. NREL's model considers a NGCC with a larger duct burner than GE's model. As the size of the duct burner increases, the efficiency of the NGCC decreases, but the value of replacing the duct burner with solar thermal power increases. Consequently, a thorough economic analysis of an ISCC plant must necessarily consider the capital and operational costs of the NGCC plant, and that capability is beyond the current scope of the SAM model.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The NREL model is described in Zhu, G., Neises, T., Turchi, C., and Bedilion, R., (2015) “Thermodynamic evaluation of solar integration into a natural gas combined cycle power plant,” Renew able Energy, Vol 74, pp. 815–824.</span></p>
<h4 class="p_Heading4"><span class="f_Heading4">Modeling Approach</span></h4>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM's model integrates solar thermal power in parallel with the NGCC high pressure boiler. To simplify control options, the NGCC model assumes that gas turbine is always operating at full power and that the duct burner is always off (in reality, the gas turbine could be throttled and the duct burner may operate in addition to the solar thermal contribution). Because of the complexity of the first-principles NGCC model, we implemented an empirical model in SAM that samples results from a more detailed model. While this approach makes an annual simulation palatable, it fixes the cycle and hybridization configuration. </span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">We ran the hybridized NGCC model over a range of possible operating conditions for the three independent operating inputs: ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and solar thermal input. We then use a three-dimensional interpolation routine to return performance results for a given set of inputs. Finally we integrated the ISCC power cycle model with SAM’s existing molten salt power tower model. This work involved developing a design point model of the molten-salt-to-steam heat exchanger that is solved at the beginning of the simulation, and then developing an off-design model of the heat exchanger for off-design operation. With this first-principles heat exchanger model, we capture the iterative interaction between the solar field and power cycle.</span></p>
<h4 class="p_Heading4"><span class="f_Heading4">SAM Implementation</span></h4>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Because of the complexity and uncertainty of NGCC costs and operation, SAM reports the electricity generation due to solar contribution. As such, SAM calculates financial metrics that represent a retrofit plant. That is: SAM assumes that the NGCC already exists, that the cost is entirely due to installing the tower and heat exchanger, and that the revenue is from electricity generated by hybridization relative to a baseline case where the NGCC does not operate the duct burner.</span></p>
