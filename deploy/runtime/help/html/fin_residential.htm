<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Debt Fraction</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Percentage of the total installed cost to be borrowed.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For example, specifying a debt fraction of 25% means that the project borrows 25% of the total installed cost amount shown on the system costs page for a 25/75 debt-equity ratio.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Loan Term</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Number of years required to repay a loan. Note that this value is different than the analysis period.</span></p>

<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Principal Amount</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The loan principal amount, or amount borrowed.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">This is a calculated value that you cannot directly edit. To change the value, change either the value of the debt fraction or a cost on the System Costs page.</span></p>
<p class="p_EquationExcel"><span class="f_EquationExcel">Principal Amount ($) = Total Installed Cost ($) × Debt Fraction (%)</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Where </span><span class="f_Emphasis">Total Installed Cost</span><span class="f_VariableDescription"> is from the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">WACC</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is defined as the minimum return that the project must earn to cover financing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">SAM displays the WACC for reference. It is not used in any calculations.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">This is calculated value that you cannot directly edit. To change its value, change one of the parameters described in the following equation:</span></p>
<p class="p_EquationExcel"><span class="f_EquationExcel">WACC = Real Discount Rate × (1 - Debt Fraction) + (1 - Effective Tax Rate) × Loan Rate × Debt Fraction</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The effective tax rate is a single number that includes both the federal income tax rate and state income tax rate. SAM uses the effective tax rate for several calculations requiring a total income tax value:</span></p>
<p class="p_EquationExcel"><span class="f_EquationExcel">Effective Tax Rate = Federal Tax Rate × ( 1 - State Tax Rate ) + State Tax Rate</span></p>
<h3 class="p_Heading3_atocs_" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none;"><span class="f_Heading3_atocs_">Analysis Parameters</span></h3>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">The analysis parameters specify the analysis period, inflation rate and discount rate.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Analysis Period</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Number of years covered by the analysis. Typically equivalent to the project or investment life. The analysis period determines the number of years in the project <a href="cashflow.htm" class="topiclink">cash flow</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Inflation Rate</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Annual rate of change of costs, typically based on a price index. SAM uses the inflation rate to calculate the value of costs in years two and later of the project cash flow based on Year One dollar values that you specify on the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page, Financing page, <a href="electricity_rates.htm" class="topiclink">Utility Rate</a> page, <a href="incentives.htm" class="topiclink">Incentives</a>, or pages.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The default value of 2.5% is based on <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/tables.htm" target="_blank" class="weblink" title="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/tables.htm">consumer price index data from the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, and is the average of the annual average consumer price index between 1991 and 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Real Discount Rate</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">A measure of the time value of money expressed as an annual rate. SAM uses the real discount rate to calculate the present value (value in year one) of dollar amounts in the project cash flow over the analysis period and to calculate annualized costs.</span></p>
<p class="p_Note"><span class="f_CHNote">Note.</span><span class="f_Note"> For projects with one of the Utility or Commercial PPA financing options, SAM includes both a discount rate and internal rate of return (IRR) in the analysis. For these projects, the discount rate represents the value of an alternative investment, and the IRR can represent a profit requirement or the risk associated with the project. For example, the IRR may be higher than the discount rate for a renewable energy project with higher risk than an alternative investment.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Nominal Discount Rate</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">SAM calculates the nominal discount based on the values of the real discount rate and the inflation rate: </span></p>
<p class="p_EquationExcel"><span class="f_EquationExcel">Nominal Discount Rate = (1 + Real Discount Rate) × (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1</span></p>
<h3 class="p_Heading3_atocs_" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none;"><span class="f_Heading3_atocs_">Tax and Insurance Rates</span></h3>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Federal and State Income Tax Rates</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The annual federal and state income tax rate applies to taxable income and is used to calculate tax benefits or liabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For all projects, taxable income includes income from any incentives marked on the <a href="incentives.htm" class="topiclink">Incentives</a> page as taxable.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For residential and commercial projects, SAM does not consider the value of electricity saved by the system to be income. However, for commercial projects, because those savings represent the value of electricity purchases that would have been a tax-deductible operating expense to the commercial entity, SAM does reduce the project after-tax cash flow by the amount of federal and state income tax on the value of the electricity. In other words, with the renewable energy system in place, the commercial entity must pay tax on that portion of its income that it would have deducted as an operating expense.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For commercial PPA and utility IPP projects, the energy value represents electricity sales that are taxable income.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Sales Tax</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The sales tax is a one-time tax that SAM includes in the project's total installed cost. SAM calculates the sales tax amount by multiplying the sales tax rate on the Financing page by the rate you specify under Indirect Capital Costs and the Total Direct Cost on the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For tax purposes, because SAM includes the sales tax amount in the total installed cost, it treats sales tax as part of the cost of property. For projects with depreciation (Commercial and Utility financing options only), SAM includes the sales tax amount in the depreciable basis. See IRS Publication 551, Basis of Assets, for more details.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Some states and other jurisdictions offer a sales tax exemption for renewable energy projects. To model a sales tax exemption in SAM, reduce the sales tax percentage as appropriate. For example, for a 100% sales tax exemption, enter a sales tax rate of zero.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">For projects with debt, because SAM includes the sales tax amount in the total installed cost, the sales tax influences the debt amount and debt interest payment. For projects where debt interest payments are deductible from federal and state income tax (all financing options except Residential with standard loan), SAM includes sales tax in the calculation of the deductions.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Insurance Rate (Annual)</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The annual insurance rate applies to the total installed cost of the project. SAM treats insurance as an operating cost for each year. The insurance cost in year one of the project cash flow is the insurance rate multiplied by the total installed cost from the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page. The first year cost is then increased by inflation in each subsequent year. For commercial and utility projects, the insurance cost is an operating expense and therefore reduces federal and state taxable income.</span></p>
<h4 class="p_Heading4"><span class="f_Heading4">Property Tax</span></h4>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">Property tax is an annual project expense that SAM includes under Operating Expenses in the <a href="cashflow.htm" class="topiclink">cash flow</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM treats property tax as a tax-deductible operating expense for each year. In each year of the project cash flow, the property tax cost is the property tax rate multiplied by the assessed value for that year. </span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM determines the annual property tax payment by calculating an assessed value for each year in the cash flow, and applying the assessed percent to that value. The assessed value may decline from year to year at the rate you specify. The assessed percent and tax rate both remain constant from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For residential projects, the property tax amount is the only operating cost that can be deducted from state and federal income tax.</span></p>
<p class="p_Note"><span class="f_CHNote">Note.</span><span class="f_Note"> For the residential and commercial financing option, SAM calculates a <a href="mtf_real_estate_added_value.htm" class="topiclink">real estate value added</a> amount for each year in the analysis period. SAM does not use the value to calculate property tax, or to calculate financial metrics such as LCOE or NPV. You can find the value on the <a href="results.htm" class="topiclink">Results</a> page <a href="data.htm" class="topiclink">Tables</a> under </span><span class="f_CHInterfaceElement">Annual Data</span><span class="f_Note">.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Assessed Percent</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The assessed value of property subject to property taxes as a percentage of the system total installed cost specified on the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page. SAM uses this value to calculate the assessed property value in year one of the project cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Assessed Value</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The assessed property value in Year One of the project cash flow:</span></p>
<p class="p_EquationExcel"><span class="f_EquationExcel">Assessed Value ($) = Assessed Percent (%) × Total Installed Cost ($)</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">Where Total Installed Cost is from the <a href="fin_residential.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Assessed Value Decline</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The annual decline in the assessed property value. SAM uses this value to calculate the property assessed value in years two and later of the project cash flow. For an assessed value that does not decrease annually, specify a value of zero percent per year.</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableName"><span class="f_VariableName">Property Tax</span></p>
<p class="p_VariableDescription"><span class="f_VariableDescription">The annual property tax rate applies to the assessed value of the project in each year of the project cash flow.</span></p>
<h3 class="p_Heading3_atocs_" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none;"><span class="f_Heading3_atocs_">Salvage Value</span></h3>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM considers the salvage value to be project income in the final year of the project cash flow, and calculates the value as a percentage of the total installed cost from the <a href="system_costs.htm" class="topiclink">System Costs</a> page.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">SAM adds the salvage value as income (a negative value) to the operating expenses in the cash flow in the final year of the analysis period. The salvage value therefore reduces the operating expenses in the final year of the analysis period. SAM reports the salvage value amount in the final year of the project <a href="cashflow.htm" class="topiclink">cash flow</a> under Operating Expenses.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For example, if you specify a 10% salvage value for a project with a 30-year analysis period, and total installed cost of $1 million, SAM includes income in Year 30 of </span><span class="f_Emphasis">$100,000 = $1,000,000 × 0.10</span><span class="f_Text">.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For residential projects, the salvage value has no effect on federal and state income tax.</span></p>
<p class="p_Text"><span class="f_Text">For commercial and utility projects, the salvage value is treated as a source of pre-tax revenue in the final year of the analysis period, increasing the federal and state taxable income.</span></p>
