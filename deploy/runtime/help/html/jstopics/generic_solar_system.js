hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Text\"><span class=\"f_Text\">The generic solar system model allows you to model a system that consists of a solar field, power block with a conventional steam turbine, and optional thermal energy storage system. The model represents the solar field using a set of optical efficiency values for different sun angles and can be used for any solar technology that uses solar energy to generate steam for electric power generation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
