The term &quot;energy yield&quot; is sometimes used to describe the total annual electrical output of a power system in kWh, and terms like &quot;specific yield,&quot; or &quot;yield&quot; are used for the kWh\/kW metric. In SAM, &quot;annual energy&quot; refers to the total annual electrical output in kWh and &quot;energy yield&quot; is the kWh\/kW metric.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
